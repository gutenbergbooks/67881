<small>WOULD IT SMILE TO HER?</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day had come at last.</p>

<p>Robert Strafford glanced around
at the isolated spot which he had
chosen for his ranch, and was seized
with more terrible misgivings than
had ever before overwhelmed him
in moments of doubt.</p>

<p>Scores of times he had tried to put
himself in her place, and to look at
the country with her eyes. Would
it, could it, smile to her? He had
put off her coming until the early
spring, so that she might see this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
new strange land at its best, when the
rains had begun to fall, and the grass
was springing up, and plain and slope
were donning a faint green garment
toning each day to a richer hue, when
tiny ferns were thrusting out their
heads from the dry ground, and here
and there a wild-flower arose, welcome
herald of the bounty which Nature
would soon be dispensing with generous
hand, but after a long delay.
Such a long delay, indeed, that a new-comer
to Southern California might
well think that Nature, so liberal in
her gifts to other lands, had shown
only scant favor to this child of hers,
clothing her in dusty and unattractive
attire, and refusing her many of
the most usual graces. But when
the long months of summer heat are
over, she begins to work her miracle,
and those who have eyes to see and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
hearts to understand, will learn how
dearly she loves this land of sunshine,
and how, in her own good time, she
showers her jewels upon it.</p>

<p>So just now, when this wonderful
change was stealing over the country,
Robert Strafford looked eagerly for
the arrival of Hilda Lester, who
had been engaged to him for more
than three years, and who was at
length able to break away from her
home-ties and marry him; when there
was a mystic glamour in the air, and
a most caressing softness; when the
lemon-trees were full of promise, and
some of them full of plenty; when
the little ranch, so carefully worked
and so faithfully nursed, seemed at
its very best, and well repaid Robert
Strafford for his untiring labor.</p>

<p>He sat on the bench in front of
his barn, smoking his pipe and glancing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
with pride at his little estate on
the slope of the hill. He loved it so
much, that he had learnt to think it
even beautiful, and it was only now
and then that he had any serious misgivings
about the impression it would
produce on any one unaccustomed to
the South Californian scenery. But
now he was seized with overwhelming
doubt, and he took his pipe from his
mouth, and covered his tired-looking
face with his hands. Nellie, the white
pointer, stirred uneasily, and then got
up and rubbed herself against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old girl,&#8221; he said, caressing
her. &#8220;You have such a faithful heart.
I&#8217;m all right, old girl; I&#8217;m only down
in the dumps a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the sound of horse&#8217;s
hoofs was heard, and Nellie, barking
loudly, darted down the hill, and then
returned in triumph, now and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
making jumps of greeting to Ben
Overleigh&#8217;s pretty little chestnut mare
Fanny.</p>

<p>Ben Overleigh swung off his horse,
hitched her to the post, and turned
quietly to his friend, who had not
risen from the bench, but sat in the
same listless position as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Ben Overleigh,
sinking down beside him, &#8220;and I
tell you, Bob, you&#8217;ve made a deuc&egrave;d
pretty little garden for her. That
deaf old woman with the ear-trumpet
has not grown finer violets than
those yonder; and as for your roses,
you could not find any better in
Santa Barbara itself. I can&#8217;t say
much for the grass-plot at present.
It reminds me rather of a man&#8217;s bald
head. But the creepers are just first
rate, especially the ones I planted.
And there isn&#8217;t a bonnier little ranch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
than yours in the whole neighbourhood.
If my lemons were coming
on as well as yours, nothing on earth
should prevent me from stepping
over to the dear old country for a
few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Strafford looked up and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The trees certainly are doing
splendidly,&#8221; he said, with some pride.
&#8220;I know I&#8217;ve given them the best
part of my strength and time these last
three years. There ought to be some
return for that, oughtn&#8217;t there, Ben?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben made no answer, but puffed
at his pipe, and Robert Strafford
continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Hilda and I had been
engaged for some time, and things
did not go well with me in the old
country,&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t make my
niche for myself like other fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
seem able to do,&mdash;and then there
came that wretched illness of mine,
which crippled all my best abilities
for the time. So when at last I set
to work again, I felt I must leave
no stone unturned to grasp some
kind of a success: here was a new
life and a new material, and I vowed
I would contrive something out of
it for Hilda and myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and came
closer to Ben Overleigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know how I ever
dared hope that she would come out
here,&#8221; he said, half-dreamily. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
longed for it and dreaded it, and
longed for it and dreaded it. If I
were to have a message now to say
she had thrown it up, I don&#8217;t suppose
I should ever want to smile
again. But that is not the worst
thing that would happen to one. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
dread something far more&mdash;her disappointment,
her scorn; for, when all
is done and said, it is a wretched
land, barren and bereft, and you
know yourself how many of the
women suffer here. They nearly all
hate it. Something dies down in
them. You have only got to look
at them to know. They have lost
the power of caring. I&#8217;ve seen it
over and over again, and then I have
cursed my lemon-trees. And I tell
you, Ben, I feel so played out by
work and doubt, and so over-shadowed,
that if Hilda hates the whole
thing, it will just be the death of me.
It will kill me outright.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Overleigh got up and shook
himself, and then relieved his feelings
in a succession of ranch-life expletives,
given forth with calm
deliberation and in a particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
musical voice, which was one of
Ben&#8217;s most charming characteristics.
He had many others too: his strong
manly presence, his innate chivalry
to every one and everything, and
his quiet loyalty, made him an attractive
personality in the valley;
and his most original and courteous
manner of swearing would have propitiated
the very sternest of tract-distributors.
He was a good friend,
too, and had long ago attached himself
to Robert Strafford, and looked
after him&mdash;mothering him up in his
own manly tender fashion; and now
he glanced at the young fellow who
was going to bring his bride home
on the morrow, and he wondered
what words of encouragement he
could speak, so that his comrade
might take heart and throw off this
overwhelming depression.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough of this nonsense,&#8221;
he said cheerily, as he stood and faced
his friend. &#8220;Come and show me
what you&#8217;ve done to make the house
look pretty. And see here, old man,
I&#8217;ve brought two or three odd things
along with me. I saw them in town
the other day, and thought they
might please her ladyship when she
arrives. I stake my reputation particularly
on this lamp-shade. And
here&#8217;s a table-cloth from the Chinese
shop, and here&#8217;s a vase for flowers,
and here&#8217;s a toasting-fork!&#8221;</p>

<p>They had gone into the house,
and Ben Overleigh had laid his
treasures one by one on the table.
He looked around, and realised for
the first time that Robert Strafford
was offering but a desolate home to
his bride. Outside at least there
were flowers and creepers, and ranges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of splendid mountains, and beautiful
soft lights and shades changing
constantly, and fragrances in the air
born of spring; but inside this dreary
little house, there was nothing to cast
a glamour of cheerfulness. Nothing.
For the moment Ben&#8217;s heart sank,
but when he glanced at his friend, he
forced himself to smile approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve bought a capital little
coal-oil stove, Bob,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That
is the best kind, undoubtedly. I&#8217;m
going to have scores of cosy meals
off that, I can tell you. I think you
could have done with two or three
more saucepans, old man. But that
is as nice a little stove as you&#8217;ll see
anywhere. A rocking-chair! Good.
And a cushion too, by Jove! And a
book-shelf, with six brand-new books
on it, including George Meredith&#8217;s
last novel and Ibsen&#8217;s new play.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Hilda is fond of reading,&#8221; said
Robert Strafford, gaining courage
from his friend&#8217;s approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;And some curtains,&#8221; continued
Ben. &#8220;And a deuc&egrave;d pretty pattern
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I chose them myself,&#8221; said the
other, smiling proudly,&mdash;&#8220;and,
what&#8217;s more, I stitched them myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went on, Ben giving comfort
and Bob taking it; and then
they made a few alterations in the
arrangement of the furniture, and
they tried the effect of the table-cloth
and the lamp-shade, and Bob put a
few flowers in the vase, and stood
at the door to see how everything
looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it smile to her, will it smile
to her, I wonder?&#8221; he said, anxiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;Of course it will,&#8221; said Ben, also
stepping back to see the whole effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;That lamp-shade and that table-cloth
and that vase and that toasting-fork
settle the whole matter, in my
mind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there were only some nice
neighbours,&#8221; said Robert Strafford.
&#8220;But there isn&#8217;t a soul within six
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surely forgetting the
deaf lady with the ear-trumpet,&#8221; remarked
Ben, mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Ben,&#8221; said
Robert Strafford, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is not exactly a stimulating
companion,&#8221; continued Ben, composedly,
&#8220;but she is better than no
one at all. And then there&#8217;s myself.
I also am better than no one at all.
I don&#8217;t think you do so badly after
all, in spite of your grumblings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Then eight miles off live Lauderdale
and Holles and Graham. Since Jesse
Holles returned from his travels, they
are as merry a little company as you
would wish to see anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hilda is so fond of music,&#8221; said
Robert Strafford, sadly, &#8220;and I have
no piano for her as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is soon remedied,&#8221; answered
Ben. &#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you
tell me these things before? The
ear-trumpet lady has a piano, and I
daresay with a little coaxing she would
lend it to you. I&#8217;m rather clever at
coaxing through a trumpet; moreover,
she rather likes me. I have
such a gentle voice, you know, and
I believe my moustache is the exact
reproduction of one owned by her
dead nephew! Her dead nephew
certainly must have had an uncommonly
fine moustache! Well, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the piano. I&#8217;ll see what I can do;
and meanwhile, for pity&#8217;s sake, cheer
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand kindly on his
friend&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Bob, I mean what I say,&#8221; he
continued; &#8220;for pity&#8217;s sake, cheer up,
and don&#8217;t be receiving her ladyship
with the countenance of a boiled
ghost. That will depress her far
more than anything in poor old
California. Be your old bright self
again, and throw off all these misgivings.
You&#8217;ve just worked yourself
out, and you ought to have taken
a month&#8217;s holiday down the coast.
You would have come back as strong
as a jack-rabbit and as chirpy as a
little horned toad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I shall be all right,&#8221; said
Robert Strafford; &#8220;and you&#8217;re such
a brick, Ben. You&#8217;ve always been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
good to me. I&#8217;ve been such a sullen
cur lately. But for all that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for all that, you&#8217;re not a bad
fellow at your best,&#8221; said Ben, smiling;
&#8220;and now come back with me.
I can&#8217;t have you mooning here by
yourself to-night. Come back with
me, and I&#8217;ll cook you a splendid
piece of steak, and I&#8217;ll send you off
in excellent form to meet and marry
her ladyship to-morrow morning.
Then whilst you are off on that
errand, I&#8217;ll turn in here and make
the place as trim as a ship&#8217;s cabin,
and serve up a nice little dinner fit
for a king and queen. Come on, old
man. I half think there may be
rain to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must just water the horses,&#8221;
said Robert Strafford, &#8220;and then I&#8217;m
ready for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two friends sauntered down to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
the stables, the pointer Nellie following
close upon their heels.</p>

<p>It was the hour of sunset, that hour
when the barren scenery can hold its
own for beauty with the loveliest
land on earth. The lights changed
and deepened, and faded away and
gave place to other colours, until at
last that tender rosy tint so dear to
those who watch the Californian sky,
jewelled the mountains and the stones,
holding everything, indeed, in a passing
splendour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her ladyship won&#8217;t see anything
like that in England,&#8221; said Ben; and
he stooped down and picked some
wild-flowers which were growing over
the ranch: Mexican primroses and
yellow violets.</p>

<p>&#8220;The ear-trumpet lady says this
is going to be a splendid year for the
wild-flowers,&#8221; he added, &#8220;so her ladyship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
will see California at its best.
But I believe we are in for some
rain. I rather wish it would keep
off until she has happily settled down
in her new home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t rain yet,&#8221; said Robert
Strafford, leading out one of the
horses to the water-trough. Then
Ben fetched the other one out; but
he broke loose and hurried up on
the hill, and Ben followed after him,
swearing in his usual patent manner
in a gentle and musical monotone,
as though he were reciting prayers
kneeling by his mother&#8217;s side. At
last the horse was caught, and the
chickens were fed, and Nellie was
chained up to keep guard over the
Californian estate. Robert mounted
his little mare Jinny and said some
words of comfort and apology to the
pointer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Poor old Nellie, woman,&#8221; he
said; &#8220;I hate to leave you by yourself.
But you must keep the house
and ranch safe for your mistress.
And I&#8217;ve given you an extra supply
of bones. And we&#8217;ll go hunting
soon, old girl, I promise you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nellie went the full length of her
chain, and watched the two men
canter off.</p>

<p>When she could no longer watch,
she listened, every nerve intent; and
when at last the sounds of the horses&#8217;
hoofs had died away in the distance,
she heaved a deep sigh, and after
the manner of all philosophers, resigned
herself to an extra supply of
bones.</p>

<small>HILDA COMES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next morning after Robert
Strafford had gone off to town
to meet Hilda, Ben Overleigh went
to his friend&#8217;s house and put everything
in order, and after having paid
special attention to the arrangement
of his moustache, he set out to visit
Miss Dewsbury, the deaf lady,
intending, if possible, to coax her
piano out of her. He was a great
favourite of hers, and he was indeed
the only person who was not thoroughly
frightened of her. She was
quite seventy years of age, but she
had unending strength and vitality,<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and worked like a navvy on her
ranch, only employing a man when
she absolutely must. And when she
did employ any one, she mounted
to the top of the house, and kept
watch over him with an opera-glass,
so that she might be quite sure she
was having the advantage of every
moment of his time. The boys in
the neighbourhood often refused to
work for her; for, as Jesse Holles
said, it was bad enough to be watched
through an opera-glass, but to have
to put up with all her scoldings, and
not be able to say a word of defence
which could reach her, except through
a trumpet&mdash;no, by Jove, that
wasn&#8217;t the job for him! Also there
were other complaints against her:
she never gave any one a decent
meal, and she never dreamed of
offering anything else but skimmed<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
milk which people did not seem
able to swallow. They swallowed
the opera-glass and the trumpet and
the scoldings and the tough beef,
but when it came to the skimmed
milk, they felt that they had already
endured enough. So the best people
in the valley would not work for
Miss Dewsbury&mdash;as least, not willingly;
and it had sometimes happened
that Ben Overleigh had used
his powers of persuasion to induce
some of the young fellows to give
her a few days&#8217; help when she was
in special need of it; and on more
than one occasion, when he could
not make any one else go to her, he
had himself offered her his services.
Thus she owed him some kindness;
and moreover his courtliness and his
gentle voice were pleasing to her.
He was the only person, so she said,<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
who did not shout down the trumpet.
And yet she could hear every
word he uttered.</p>

<p>This morning when he arrived at
her house, she was vainly trying to
hear what the butcher said, and the
butcher was vainly trying to make
himself understood. She was in a
state of feverish excitement, and the
butcher looked in the last stage of
nervous exhaustion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve just come in time to
save my life,&#8221; he said to Ben. &#8220;For
the love of heaven, tell her through
the trumpet, that beef has gone up
two cents a pound, that she can&#8217;t
have her salted tongue till next
week, and that she has given me
seven cents too little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Ben of the magic voice
spoke these mystic words through
the trumpet, and the butcher went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
off comforted, and Miss Dewsbury
smiled at her favourite; and when
he told her that he had come to
ask a special favour of her, she was
so gracious that Ben felt he would
have no difficulty in carrying out
his project. But when she understood
what he wanted, things did
not go so easily. To be sure, she
did not use the piano, she said, but
then that was no reason why any
one else should use it for her. Ben
stood waiting patiently until she
should have exhausted all her eloquence,
and then he stooped down,
and quietly picked one or two suckers
off a lemon-tree, and took his
pruning-knife from his pocket, and
snipped off a faded branch. After
this, with quiet deliberation, he twirled
his great moustaches. That settled
the matter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;You may have the piano,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;but you must fetch it yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben did not think it necessary to
add that he had already arranged
for it to be fetched at once, and he
lingered a little while with her, listening
to her complaint about the
men she employed and about their
laziness, which she observed through
the opera-glass. Ben was just going
to suggest that perhaps the opera-glass
made the men lazy, when he
remembered that he must be circumspect,
and so he contrived some
beautiful speech about the immorality
of laziness; he even asked for
a glass of skimmed milk, and off he
cantered, raising his hat and bowing
chivalrously to the old lady rancher.
Before very long, her piano stood in
Robert Strafford&#8217;s little house, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Ben spent a long time in cleaning
and dusting it.</p>

<p>After he had finished this task,
he became very restless, and finally
went down to the workshop and
made a rough letter-box, which he
fixed on to a post and placed at the
corner of the road leading up to
his friend&#8217;s ranch. Two hours were
left. He did a little gardening and
watered the tiny grass-plot. He
looked at the sky. Blue-black
clouds were hovering over the mountains,
obscuring some and trying to
envelop others.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are in for a storm,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It is making straight for this part
from Grevilles Mountain. But I hope
it won&#8217;t come to-night. It will be a
poor welcome to Bob&#8217;s wife, though
it&#8217;s about time now for the land to
have a thorough good drenching.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>He looked at the pretty valley
with its belt of trees, seen at its best
from the hill where Robert&#8217;s house
was built. At all times of the year,
there was that green stretch yonder
of clustering trees, nestling near the
foothills, which in their turn seemed
to nestle up to the rugged mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, as he turned away,
&#8220;those trees make one home-sick for
a wooded country. These wonderful
ranges of mountains and these
hills are all very well in their way,
and one learns to love them tremendously,
but one longs for the trees.
And yet when Jesse Holles went
north and came back again, he said
he was glad to see the barren mountains
once more. I wonder what the
girl will think of it all, and how she
will take to the life. The women
suffer miseries of home-sickness.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>He stood thinking a while, and
there was an expression of great sadness
on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My own little sweetheart would
have pined out here,&#8221; he said softly;
&#8220;I can bear the loneliness, but I
could not have borne hers. Poor old
Bob,&#8221; he said regretfully, &#8220;I almost
wish he had not sent for her: it is
such a risk in this land. I don&#8217;t
wonder he is anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced again at the threatening
clouds, and went back to the
house, took off his coat, turned up
his sleeves, and began the preparations
for the evening meal. He laid
the cloth, changed the flowers several
times before they smiled to his satisfaction,
and polished the knives and
forks. He brought in some logs of
wood and some sumac-roots, made a
fire, and blew it up with the bellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p045.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;BEN LIT THE LANTERN, AND STATIONED HIMSELF<br />
OUTSIDE WITH IT.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Suddenly the frail little frame-house
was shaken by a heavy gust
of wind; and when the shock had
passed, every board creaked and
quivered. Nellie got up from her
warm place near the fire, and stalked
about uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Damnation!&#8221; said Ben. &#8220;The
storm is working up. If they&#8217;d only
come before it is any worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now seven o&#8217;clock and pitch
dark. Ben lit the lantern, and stationed
himself outside with it. The
time seemed endless to him, but at
last he heard the music of wheels,
and in a few minutes the horse
dashed up the hill, and Robert&#8217;s
voice rang out lustily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here she is, Ben!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, here I am,&#8221; said Robert&#8217;s
wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time to escape the storm,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
said Ben, coming forward to greet
her, and helping her out of the
buggy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been awfully anxious
about you both. I&#8217;ll take the horse
down to the barn, Bob, and then
I&#8217;ll fly up to see about the dinner.
Leave everything to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So whilst Ben was unhitching the
horse, Robert led his wife into the
little house, and he was transfigured
with pride and pleasure when she
glanced round and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how cosy you&#8217;ve made it!
And how cheerful the fire looks!
And this dear dog ready to be so
friendly. It looks like a real little
home&mdash;doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>In that one moment all Robert&#8217;s
doubts and misgivings were set at
rest, and when Ben hurried up from
the barn, the husband and wife were
kneeling down and toasting themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
before the fire, the dog nestling
up near them, and he heard Robert
asking questions about the dear old
country, and Hilda answering in a
voice which struck on Ben&#8217;s sensitive
ear as being somewhat harsh and
strident. He had only time to glance
hastily at her as, intent on serving up
a dainty little dinner as quickly as
possible, he passed into the kitchen.
At last he brought it in triumphantly,
hot steak cooked as only Ben knew
how, and fried potatoes and chicken
salad, and the most fragrant coffee.
Finally, overcome with his exertions
and his anxiety and his day&#8217;s working
and waiting, with a sigh of relief he
sank back in his chair and twirled his
great moustaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been such a good friend
to Bob,&#8221; said Hilda, smiling at him.
&#8220;I know all about it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; said Ben, with his easy
grace, &#8220;I&#8217;ve only helped to get him
through the time until you came out
to him. The poor wretch needed
cheering up. But he does not look
much like a poor wretch now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; laughed Robert,
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t feel like one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve often been a great anxiety
to me,&#8221; said Ben, turning to
Hilda. &#8220;When the mails have been
delayed and your letters have not
come at their appointed minute, then
I have had to suffer. And once you
were ill. During that period I was
not allowed any peace of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In fact, you have had bad times
on my account,&#8221; she said brightly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p051.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;AND HE HEARD ROBERT ASKING QUESTIONS.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>&#8220;Well, I could not bear to see
him suffer,&#8221; Ben said, laying his arm
on Robert&#8217;s shoulder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> &#8220;He is a
terrible fellow at taking things to
heart. There is no doing anything
at all with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has suffered quite unnecessarily,&#8221;
Hilda answered, with that
peculiar harsh ring in her voice which
again jarred on Ben&#8217;s sensitiveness.
&#8220;I am one of the strong ones of the
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she looked it. Though tired
after the long journey from England,
she had the appearance of being in
excellent health. Her complexion
was dark, and her eyes were brown,
but without any softness in them.
She was decidedly good-looking,
almost beautiful indeed, and strikingly
graceful of form and stature.
But she impressed Ben as being quite
unsympathetic, and all the time he
was washing up the tea things and
tidying the little kitchen, he found
himself harping on this note alone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>And when he had said good-bye
to Robert and Hilda, and was hurrying
home on his pretty little mare
Fanny, he gave vent, in his usual
musical fashion, to a vague feeling of
disappointment, and kept up a soft
accompaniment of swearing to the
howling of the wind.</p>

<small>GROWING REGRETS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was now three days since
Hilda&#8217;s arrival; and the storm,
which had been threatening for so
long, had not yet broken loose.
Like all the ranchers, Robert was
anxious for a good deluge, but he
was relieved that there was a little
delay about it, for he wanted Hilda
to enjoy a few days of outdoor life,
and see all he had to show her on
the ranch and in the garden. He
seemed like a different man now that
she had come out to him; and every
tiny mark of appreciation which she
gave, made him lift his head higher,<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and encouraged him to step more
firmly over the ground. The labour,
the anxiety, and the risk of his enterprise
were all forgotten in the intense
pride and pleasure with which
he showed her what he had been doing
to ensure success. He told her,
with quiet confidence in the ultimate
truth of his words, that his lemons
could not possibly be a failure.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will hear many people say
that there is no money in fruit-farming,&#8221;
he said to her when he was taking
her over the ranch and pointing
out to her his pet trees. &#8220;But you
need not be concerned about that.
The big ranches often fail because
they are too unwieldy, and some of
the small ranches fail because they
are not properly looked after, and
because their owners have not enough
capital to spend money on them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
to wait patiently for a good return.
But a ranch of twenty-five acres carefully
tended in every particular cannot
help being a success. Those are
my best trees yonder. They are
specially fine, and I expect to net
two dollars a box on them next year.
I can&#8217;t tell you how much care I
have given to them, but you see for
yourself that it was well worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda tried to make some appropriate
remark, but the trees did not
really arouse any interest in her: she
was bitterly disappointed with them,
for, in spite of all Robert&#8217;s letters
telling her that the orchard was only
in its infancy, she had expected to
see great groves of trees covered with
lemons and oranges. And really
until one learns to take a delight
in the quick growth, one may well
feel disappointment and perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
contempt. Some amusing criticisms,
with a spice of derision in them, rose
to her lips, but she managed to shut
them off, and followed her husband
silently up the trail which led to his
reservoir, on which he set great store.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is a thoroughly
satisfactory piece of work.
It cost a good deal of money and
labour, but it is splendidly strong.
In this dry land, it is such an immense
advantage to be able to store
water.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda praised the reservoir, and
suggested they should grow some
trees there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; Robert said eagerly,
&#8220;we will have trees everywhere, and
you shall choose them and settle
where they are to be planted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you plant some
shade trees at once?&#8221; she asked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
&#8220;The whole place is so terribly bare.
I could not have believed that such
a barren spot existed anywhere outside
a desert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert&#8217;s face fell, and Hilda
added quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;But these are grand old mountains
around us, and I daresay one
gets accustomed to the bareness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and in
time one almost learns to think it
beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful, no,&#8221; she replied decidedly,
&#8220;but perhaps tolerable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day,&#8221; he said, almost
pleadingly, &#8220;you will see a difference
in the scenery. If we have
some more rain, as we shall do
shortly, you will see the green
springing up everywhere. The most
dried-up-looking corner will suddenly
become jewelled with wild-flowers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
In about three weeks&#8217; time
that little hill yonder above our
ranch will be covered with scented
yellow lilies. Down in the valley
you will find green enough to satisfy
the hungriest eye, and up on the
mountains where you must go on
horseback, the brushwood is coming
on splendidly, and all sorts of lovely
flowers and shrubs are springing up.
And there you will have a grand
view of the surrounding mountains,
and the Pacific. You will even feel
the sea-breeze, and at times you will
hear the sound of the waves.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and
Hilda said brightly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall enjoy the riding immensely.
Can I begin soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At once,&#8221; he answered proudly
again. &#8220;Come and make friends
with Bessie, and see the side-saddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
which I bought for you the other
day. It&#8217;s a Mexican one, and I
think it is the safest for this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had taken thought for her in
every way, and she could not but
notice it and be grateful for it; and
as the days went on, she grew more
conscious of the evidences of his
kindness, and all the more anxious
to do her part conscientiously. She
threw herself into work to which she
had been totally unaccustomed all
her life, and for which she had
no liking; but because she had a
strong will and a satisfaction in doing
everything well, she made astonishing
progress, illustrating the truth
sometimes disputed by ungenerous
critics, that a good groundwork of
culture and education helps and does
not hinder one in the practical and
unpoetical things of life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>But nevertheless she recognised
that she had made a great mistake.
Looking back now she wondered
why in the name of heaven she had
ever come out to this distant land,
and got herself entangled in a life
which could never be congenial to
her; for once there, and having seen
her surroundings and her limitations,
she realised that it could never be
attractive to her. She had loved
Robert as well as she could love any
one, and when his health broke down
and he had to leave England, she
continued her engagement as a matter
of course, and his letters of love
and longing were acceptable to her,
not involving any strain on her part,
nor any pressing need of arranging
definitely for the future. So she
drifted on, and when at last the question
arose of her joining him, her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
relations and friends used every opposition
to prevent her. It was
pointed out to her that after a London
life full of many interests and
possibilities and actualities, ranching
in Southern California would be
simply madness. She had been
accustomed to companions, men and
women of a certain amount of culture
and refinement. How would
she manage, bereft of all these advantages?
The strenuous opposition
with which she met, and the
solid arguments advanced against her
leaving the old country, stimulated
her desire to go; and a sudden wave
of loyalty and pity for that lonely
rancher who was counting on her
help and companionship, confirmed
her in her intentions. She felt that
if she had not been intending to
keep her promise, she ought at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
to have let him know the drift of
her mind. This, and a very decided
inclination for travel and adventures,
settled the matter.</p>

<p>So she came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p065.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;SHE SAT ON THE LITTLE VERANDAH.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>And this afternoon, when she sat
on the little verandah, resting after
her housework, and watching Robert
cultivating the eight-acre piece on the
hill-slope, she realised that she had
been mad. He paused for a moment
and waved to her, and she waved
back listlessly. She looked at the
rich upturned soil, of chocolate brown,
and the formal rows of lemon-trees;
at the stretch of country all around
her, with scarcely a sign of human
habitation; at the great mountains,
uncompromisingly stern and barren
of everything except stone and brush.
She watched the pointer Nellie going
in front of the little grey team and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
encouraging them to do their work
well. She glanced upwards and
noticed the majestic flight of the
turkey buzzards, and now she was
attracted by the noise of a hummingbird
who came to visit her fragrant
honeysuckle creeper, and then sped
on his way. Everything seemed so
still and lifeless. There were no
familiar noises such as greet one in
the tiniest village in the old country.
There was no pulsation nor throb of
life. There was nothing to stimulate,&mdash;nothing
in the circumstances of
everyday life, nor in the scenery.
With the exception of her husband,
there was no one with whom to speak
all through the living hours of the
day.</p>

<p>And this was what she had chosen
of her own free will. She had deliberately
thrown up a life full of interests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and distractions, and had been mad
enough to exchange it for this.</p>

<p>She was fond of music, and would
hear none.</p>

<p>She was fond of theatres, and she
had cut herself off from them.</p>

<p>As for books&mdash;well, she could get
them here; but meanwhile Meredith&#8217;s
&#8220;Lord Ormont and his Aminta&#8221; lay
unopened by her side, and the current
number of the &#8220;Century&#8221; was thrown
down and carelessly crumpled. But
as she stooped to pick it up, she was
ashamed to think how ungrateful she
was for all Robert&#8217;s kindness. He
had filled a little book-shelf with
new books for her; he had subscribed
for several of the best magazines; he
had sent for a tuner from town to
tune the ear-trumpet lady&#8217;s piano.
She scarcely cared to read, and she
had not touched the piano. A feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of tenderness and gratitude came
over her, and she sprang up, and
trudged over the fields to speak a
few words with her husband. His
face brightened when he saw her,
and he gave her a joyous welcome.
Nellie ran to greet her, and the horses
looked round inquiringly. For the
moment she felt really proud and
happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must let me help you all I
can,&#8221; she said gently. &#8220;I am so
strong, and able to do so much. You
look dreadfully tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; he said,
smiling, and wiping his forehead.
&#8220;Everything seems different since
you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you teach me, I can do the
pruning,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I believe I
could cultivate too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you could,&#8221; he answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
&#8220;and perhaps you think too
that I am going to allow you to dig
the basins for the irrigating during
the summer. But you shall do the
pruning, and next year, you know,
there will be the curing of the
lemons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Next year</i>,&#8221; she repeated slowly,
and her heart sank once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve half decided to plant some
walnuts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t
bear for about nine years, but then
they are very profitable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Nine years</i>,&#8221; she echoed, and a
throb of pain passed through her.</p>

<p>But at that moment Ben Overleigh
came cantering over the ranch,
with a rifle in front of him and some
quail which he had just shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my first offering of
quail,&#8221; he said, turning to Hilda,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve shot them with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
pretty little rifle which Jesse Holles
is sending as a present to you. He
is too shy to give it to you himself.
Though you won&#8217;t think him shy
when you see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when shall I see him?&#8221;
asked Hilda, who had brightened up
considerably, and looked beautiful.</p>

<p>&#8220;This evening,&#8221; answered Ben,
glancing at her admiringly. &#8220;The
fact is, I came to tell you that in
about an hour&#8217;s time you may expect
seven callers. Lauderdale and
Graham and Holles and some of the
other boys intend to pay you their
respects this evening. They fear
lest they may be prevented later on
by the storm which I&#8217;ve prophesied
for the last fortnight, and which I
shall continue to prophesy with unfailing
persistence until it comes.
You will find Holles most amusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
if he is in good form. But he
has been quite ill for the last three
weeks, and is only just himself again.
He made nine wills and wrote six
farewell letters in twenty-one days,
and he said they helped him to recover.
He looked in at my place
this morning and asked for a tie, and
Graham pleaded for a collar, and
when I heard why they wanted these
articles of luxury, I thought I had
better come a little earlier and warn
you, as seven visitors are rather a large
bunch of grapes, even in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we will go in and get ready
for them,&#8221; Hilda said, delighted at the
prospect of company. &#8220;How nice of
Mr. Holles to send the rifle! May
I fire a shot now, Mr. Overleigh?
I should so much like to try.&#8221;</p>

<p>He showed her how to use the
rifle, loaded it for her, and nodded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
in approval to Robert when she took
a steady aim at a mark which they
had placed for her, and hit it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Ben, cheerily;
&#8220;we can send her out to shoot the
deer in the mountains, Bob. Perhaps
she will have better luck than
we do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; laughed Robert, as he
turned the horses homeward. &#8220;Be
sure and ask Holles, Hilda, what is
the greatest number of deer he has
ever shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda promised not to forget, and
hurried into the house to make her
preparations for the guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will rain to-night,&#8221; Ben said;
&#8220;it can&#8217;t help itself any longer. Just
look yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe you are right at
last,&#8221; answered Robert, unhitching
the horses from the cultivator.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE seven callers came as threatened,
and Hilda began to
think that perhaps there was some
kind of companionship possible in
the wilds of Southern California.
She was delighted with these young
English fellows, and sat in the midst
of them, laughing at their fun, listening
to their stories, and answering
their eager questions about the
dear old country for which they all
longed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does the Strand look?&#8221;
asked Graham.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;Does Tottenham Court Road
seem the same as ever?&#8221; asked
Lauderdale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has Park Lane changed at all?&#8221;
asked Holles, putting on airs of great
superiority.</p>

<p>In spite of his recent illness, he
was in capital spirits, and seemed to
be much liked by his companions.
&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve been quite ill,&#8221; he said,
in answer to Hilda&#8217;s inquiries; &#8220;but
Lauderdale nursed me beautifully,
and made me drink about a dozen
bottles of Elliman&#8217;s embrocation,
and then I got well enough to write
several parting letters to my friends
in England, and to make my will.
And that&#8217;s a very puzzling thing to
do satisfactorily when you have many
valuable things to leave. I left my
pipe first to Lauderdale, then to
Graham, then to Bob, and then to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Ben Overleigh, and finally I kept it
for myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to have kept your
rifle for yourself,&#8221; Hilda said graciously,
&#8220;though I am glad you did
not. I am delighted to have it from
you, and hope to do it justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A rifle is a very handy thing to
have in this country,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;One may want it at any moment
for a coyote, or a jack-rabbit, or a
Mexican.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or perhaps a deer!&#8221; suggested
Hilda, slyly.</p>

<p>They all laughed at that, and Jesse
Holles as heartily as any one, and
then Ben said he thought they ought
to be starting home. It was evident
that none of them wanted to go, and
Holles, being particularly fond of
music, was looking at the piano;
but Ben seemed anxious about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
weather, and insisted on their leaving
at once with him. They called him
the High Binder, explaining to Hilda
the exact meaning of a High Binder,
and his mysterious and subtle influence
over his Chinese compatriots,
whom he ruled with an iron rod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just see how we all quail before
him,&#8221; said Holles, who had been
talking incessantly the whole evening;
&#8220;and no doubt you&#8217;ve observed
how speechless we are in his presence.
He has only to wag his pig-tail and
we go flat on our faces at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be such a confounded ass,&#8221;
said Ben, laughing. &#8220;Come along,
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, man alive,&#8221; said Holles,
&#8220;but at least let me finish this piece
of cake first. We don&#8217;t get cake
like this at your place, Ben. Do you
know, Mrs. Strafford, when we want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to kill coyotes, we get Ben to make
us some of his best sponge-rusks.
That does the trick at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you give them to
the deer also?&#8221; suggested Hilda, mischievously.
There was a shout of
laughter at this, and Robert lit the
lantern, and opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s raining, boys,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;and what&#8217;s more, it is coming on
harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for California!&#8221; sang
out Graham; &#8220;we shall all make
our fortunes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Robert Strafford, &#8220;we
shall all be saved if the country gets
a thorough good drenching. But
you will be pretty well sprinkled by
the time you reach home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; replied Holles,
cheerily. &#8220;I&#8217;m the only delicate
one, you know, and the others won&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
take much harm, being of coarser
fibre. And I have nothing on to
spoil except the High Binder&#8217;s tie,
which I will put in my pocket. So
good-night, Mrs. Strafford, and three
cheers for yourself and Bob and dear
old England.&#8221;</p>

<p>The High Binder and the seven
other callers gave three ringing cheers
and cantered off to their homes.
Long before they reached their destinations,
the storm broke forth with
unbridled fury. The rain poured
down in torrents, gaining in force
and rage every moment. The wind
suddenly rose, and all but swept away
the riders and their horses, and
shook to its very foundation the
frail little frame-house where Robert
and Hilda were watching by the
log-fire, listening to the cracking and
creaking and groaning of the boards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
The wind rose higher and higher.
It seemed as though the little house
must assuredly be caught up and
hurled headlong. Now and then
Nellie got up and howled, and Hilda
started nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Robert said reassuringly.
&#8220;The wind will soon
drop, and as for the rain, we have
wanted it badly. We should all
have been ruined this year, if the
wet season had not set in. It&#8217;s
all right, Nell. Lie down, old girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the wind did not drop. Hour
after hour it raged and threatened,
and together with the tremendous
downpouring of the rain, and the
rushing of the water in streams over
the ground, made a deafening tumult.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had kept those boys,&#8221;
Robert said once or twice. &#8220;It is
not fit for any one to be out on such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
a night. When these storms come,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;I always feel so thankful
that Ben urged me to buy land
on the hill-slopes rather than in the
valley. Three years ago there was
fearful damage done in the valley.
One of the ranchers had eight acres
of olives completely ruined by the
floods from the river. You must
see the river to-morrow. You saw
it yesterday, didn&#8217;t you? Well,
you will not recognise it after a day
or two if the rain continues. And
from the verandah you will hear it
roaring like the ocean.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later on he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather wish I hadn&#8217;t filled
up my reservoir so full with flume-water.
It never struck me to make
allowances for the rain coming, idiot
that I am. But there is a good deal
of seepage going on, and I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
I might as well fill it up to just
below the overflow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not anxious about it?&#8221;
she asked kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said, cheerfully;
&#8220;but I shall go out early to-morrow
morning, and raise the flood-gate,
just to be well on the safe side.
One can&#8217;t be too careful about reservoirs.
They are the very devil if
the dam bursts. But mine is as
solid as a fortress. I&#8217;d stake my
life on that. I worked like ten navvies
over that earth dam. I used to
feel rather like that man in Victor
Hugo&#8217;s &#8216;Toilers of the Sea.&#8217; Do
you remember how he slaved over
his self-imposed task?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Bob,&#8221; she said, bending
over him, and speaking in a
gentler voice than was her wont,
&#8220;and you are not in the least fit for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
such hard work. I believe you have
worn yourself out; and all for me,
and I, if you only knew, so little
worthy of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted our little ranch to be
just as compact as possible,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;so that I might offer to you the best
I could in this distant land. As for
myself, I am perfectly well, now
you&#8217;ve come out to me: only I am
always wishing that I could have
made a home for you in the old
country. I never forget it whatever
I am doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seemed to be waiting for an
answer, but Hilda was silent, and
when at last she spoke, it was about
her seven callers, and the next moment
there was a terrible blast of
wind, and the door was blown in and
hurled with a crash to the ground.
After that, their whole attention was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
taken up in trying to keep out the
rain, and in securing the windows,
until at last, worn out with their long
watch, they slept.</p>

<p>Hilda dreamed of England, and
of everything she had left there.
She dreamed that she heard Robert
saying: &#8220;<i>And next year there will
be the lemons to be cured.</i>&#8221; &#8220;<i>Next
year</i>,&#8221; she answered, and her heart
sank.</p>

<p>Robert dreamed of the eight acres
of olives ruined by the floods three
years ago, and of his own ranch situated
so safely on the hill-slope, and
of his reservoir. He dreamed he
was still working at it, still strengthening
the earth dam, and still scraping
out the ca&ntilde;on so as to have
room for about five hundred thousand
gallons of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p085.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;HE LIFTED A PIECE OF IRON PIPING.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;<i>It&#8217;s nearly done</i>,&#8221; he said; &#8220;<i>about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
three weeks more, and then I&#8217;m through
with it</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>At six o&#8217;clock he woke up with a
start, and found the storm unabated
in strength and fury. Suddenly he
remembered about his reservoir, and,
seized with a sudden panic, he flung
out of the house, and, fighting his
way through the rain and wind,
crossed the ranch, and tore up the
trail which led to the reservoir.</p>

<p>For one second he stood paralysed.</p>

<p>The water was just beginning to
flow over the earth dam. He had
come too late, and he knew it. He
lifted a piece of iron piping which
lay there at hand, and he tried to
knock out the flood-gate, but the
mischief was done. In less than ten
minutes, the water had cut a hole
five feet deep in the dam, and was
rushing down the ranch, carving for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
itself a gully which widened and deepened
every second.</p>

<p>In the blinding rain and wind
Robert Strafford stood helpless and
watched the whole of the dam give
way: he watched the water tearing
madly over the best part of his
ranch: he saw numbers of his choicest
lemon-trees rooted up and borne
away: he saw the labour of weeks
and months flung, as it were, in his
face. And he was helpless. It was
all over in half an hour, and still he
lingered there, as though rooted to
the spot,&mdash;drenched by the rain,
blown by the wind, and unconscious
of everything except this bitter disappointment.
But when his mind
began to work again, he thought of
Hilda: how it was through him that
she had left her home and her surroundings
and all her many interests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
and had come to him to this far-off
country, to this loveless land, to this
starved region&mdash;yes, to this starved
region, where people were longing
and pining for even a passing throb
of the old life, for even a glance at
a Devonshire lane or a Surrey hill;
for some old familiar scene of beauty
or some former sensation of mental
or artistic satisfaction; for something&mdash;no
matter what&mdash;but just something
from the old country which
would feel like the touch of a loved
hand on a bowed head. He was holding
out his arms, and his heart and
whole being were leaping towards the
bless&egrave;d land which had nurtured him:
even as tiny children cry out for
their mother, and can be comforted
and satisfied by her alone. Ah, his
thoughts of, and his desires for his
old home, had broken down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
barrier of control, and were tearing
wildly onwards like that raging torrent
yonder. And the more he desired
the dear old country and thought
of it, all the more bitterly did he reproach
himself for taking Hilda away
from it, for urging her to come and
cut herself off from the things most
worth having in life&mdash;<i>and for what</i>?
To share his exile, and his loneliness,
and his failure. That was all he
had to offer her, and he might have
known it from the beginning, and if
he could not save himself, at least
he might have spared her.</p>

<p>At last he turned away suddenly,
and, battling with the storm, made
his way home. Hilda ran out to
meet him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert,&#8221; she said, seeing his pale
face, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been so anxious&mdash;what
has happened?&mdash;what is the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;Do you hear that noise?&#8221; he
said excitedly; &#8220;do you hear the
roar of that torrent? It is our reservoir
let loose over our ranch. How
do you like having married a man
who has failed in everything?&#8221;</p>

<small>DOWN BY THE RIVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL through that most miserable
day Hilda gave him the best
of her sympathy and kindness; but
even her best was poor of quality and
scant of quantity, and it did not avail
to rouse him from his despair. She
was too new to Californian life to understand
the whole meaning of the
morning&#8217;s misfortune, and apart from
this, her power of comforting lacked
the glow and warmth of passionate
attachment. Still, she gave to her
uttermost farthing, but nothing she
could do or say had the effect of
helping him. He crouched by the<span class="pagenum3" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
fire, a broken man seemingly, now
and again piling on the sumac-roots,
and sometimes glancing at her as she
passed to and fro busy with the affairs
of their little household. She served
the mid-day meal and urged him to
break his fast, but he shook his head,
and drew nearer to the fire. At about
three o&#8217;clock, there was a lull in the
storm, and the rain ceased.</p>

<p>Hilda, who was feeling utterly
wretched and perplexed, went out to
the verandah and listened to the roar
of the river, and saw a silver streak
in the valley which two days before
had been perfectly dry. She had
laughed when she was told that the
sandy waste yonder was the great
river. Now, looking at it, she was
seized with a strong desire to go down
and stand near it, and she was just debating
in her mind whether she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
leave Robert, and whether she could
get through the day without some
kind of distraction,&mdash;no matter what,
but something to brace her up a little,&mdash;when
she saw a figure coming up
the hill, and at once recognised Ben
Overleigh. A strong feeling of relief
and hope took possession of her.
Ben would stay with Robert whilst
she went out and saw what there was
to be seen, and then she would come
back refreshed in mind and body.
He would know how to comfort
Robert, and as for herself, she was
quite conscious that she brightened
up in his presence, and felt less hopeless
too about this lonely ranch life
when she remembered that he was a
neighbor and their friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, greeting her, &#8220;and
so you&#8217;ve seen a typical Californian
rain-storm. I tell you, you are lucky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
to be on the hill. I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if there was a great deal of damage
done in the valley. And the
storm is not over yet. This is only
a lull, but I thought I would just
come over to see how things have
been going with you. Where is
Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob is inside, crouching over the
fire,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He should take you down to see
the river,&#8221; Ben said. &#8220;It is a tremendous
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I half thought of going by myself,&#8221;
she said gloomily, &#8220;if only for
the sake of a little distraction. Bob
is in trouble; we are both in trouble.
The reservoir burst this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; said Ben, &#8220;and
you talk of it as though your band-box
had burst, and that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She darted an indignant glance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
him as he opened the door hastily
and went into the house. He laid
his hands heavily on Bob&#8217;s shoulders
and said: &#8220;Cheer up, old man.
I&#8217;ve come to smoke a pipe with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben, old fellow,&#8221; Robert Strafford
said, looking up, and feeling at
once the comfort of his presence.</p>

<p>There was no talk between them:
they sat together by the fireside,
whilst Hilda lingered outside on the
verandah.</p>

<p>At last Robert spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;My best trees are gone,&#8221; he said
half-dreamily; &#8220;the best part of my
ranch is ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll redeem it,&#8221; Ben answered,
&#8220;you and I together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p097.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;THERE WAS NO TALK BETWEEN THEM.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />


<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no redeeming it,&#8221; he
said quietly; &#8220;I&#8217;ve made another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
failure of my life, and dragged the
girl into it this time. And I can&#8217;t
forgive myself. And she has been
so good and patient all through this
wretched day. She has not come
out to anything very gay, has she?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the moment Ben&#8217;s thoughts
turned sympathetically to Hilda, and
he regretted his hasty words. No;
Bob was right: she had not come
out to anything very gay: a barren
life, a worn-out worker, and a ruined
ranch,&mdash;not a particularly sumptuous
marriage portion for any one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I shall take her down to
the river,&#8221; he said suddenly. &#8220;She
half wanted to go, and it is not safe
for her alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert nodded as though in approval,
and showed no further interest
in outside things. Ben saw that
it was better to leave him alone, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
slipped out quietly, having asked no
questions about the reservoir. But
he soon saw for himself that the
finest part of Robert&#8217;s ranch was a
scene of desolation, and his heart
ached for his friend. Then he came
round to the honeysuckle verandah,
and saw Hilda still standing there.
She looked utterly listless and depressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I take you down to the
river?&#8221; he asked, in his own kind
way. &#8220;Bob is better alone, and the
walk will do you good. Put on
some thick boots, for the mud is
something awful. You don&#8217;t mind
heavy walking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; she answered eagerly,
&#8220;I shall be glad to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were making
their way down to the valley,
now sticking in the mud, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
going valiantly onwards without interruption.
At first Ben could not
bring himself to speak of the trouble
which had befallen his friend; he felt
as though Hilda did not understand,
or as though she did not care. Yet
it was impossible that she did not
care. No, she was, so he argued,
probably one of those reserved characters,
who keep their emotions in
an iron safe, proof against all attacks.
But at last he could no longer keep
silent on the subject which was uppermost
in his thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a most disastrous affair, this
bursting of the reservoir,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Bob slaved like a nigger at that
earth dam. I never saw any fellow
work so hard. And there never was
a doubt in our minds about it being
as firm as a rock. He has not told
me a word about it yet, and I did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
not like to ask. He will tell me in
his own time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had filled the reservoir too
full,&#8221; Hilda said, in her grating voice.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why he did such a
ridiculous thing when he knew the
rain was coming. And then there
was some trouble about the flood-gate.
It would not act properly.
That is how it has occurred: at least
so he told me. Day after day he
put off looking after that flood-gate,
until it was too late. I am dreadfully
sorry about it all, but I cannot
think why he did not take proper
precautions. I would not say that to
him, of course, but it seems to me that
it might have been prevented if&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Bob had not been utterly
worn out,&#8221; said Ben, brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is altogether most unfortunate,&#8221;
she said indifferently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Ben glanced at her keenly, scarcely
knowing how to control his indignation
at her cold criticism of his friend.
He was trying to make out what
manner of woman she really was,
trying to divine what kind of heart
she had, and what degree of intelligence;
for she apparently did not
realise the seriousness of the disaster,
and talked of it as though it were
something outside her, in the consequences
of which she had no part.</p>

<p>&#8220;I scarcely think this is the moment
for criticism,&#8221; he said suddenly;
&#8220;it is the moment for generous sympathy.
Bob will need everything we
can give him of help and kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I don&#8217;t know
that?&#8221; she asked coldly. &#8220;Do you
imagine that I am intending to make
things harder for him? What do
you suppose I am?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;I suppose you are what you are,&#8221;
Ben answered, in his quiet deliberate
way, &#8220;a new-comer to California,
ignorant of our lives out here, our
struggles, our weeks and months and
years of unaccustomed toil, and our
great anxieties, and our great disasters.
Your ranch is practically
ruined. All those trees would have
borne splendid lemons next year.
Bob has tended them with special
care. Now they are swept away.
The part of your ranch which is left
uninjured by the bursting of the reservoir,
is the newly planted part.
About two or three months ago, I
myself helped Bob to put in the trees.
Now he will have to begin all over
again. And it is just crushing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and
even in the midst of his exasperation
at her indifference, and in spite of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
sympathy with Bob, he felt a rush of
kindly feeling towards her. There
she was amongst them in a foreign
land, with none of her own people
and none of her former interests,&mdash;no,
she had not come out to anything
very cheerful: and at twenty-four,
and three weeks married, one
has a right to expect some satisfaction
out of life.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I am not a very gay companion,&#8221;
he said, with sudden cheeriness.
&#8220;You have had enough sadness
for one day, and here am I doing
my level best to add to it. Holles
always says that if I had chosen, I
could have written an admirable Book
of Lamentations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a most amusing boy,&#8221;
Hilda said, smiling in spite of herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day when he is in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
form you must make him tell you his
adventures on a fishing expedition,&#8221;
said Ben. &#8220;And some day you
must ask him about his famous
quarrel with the ear-trumpet lady,
your only neighbour. He does just
what he likes with us all, and we&#8217;re
ridiculously fond of him. That is
his place right over there, across the
river. And now what do you think
of the river? Stay, let me go first
and test the way across the meadows,
and you must follow exactly in my
footsteps, and we will get up to the
very bank of the torrent. Don&#8217;t
choose your own path. The ground
is fearfully soft, and you may be mired
if you&#8217;re not careful. Would you
rather not go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed not,&#8221; she said eagerly;
&#8220;I am ready for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had forgotten all her troubles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and depression, and, buoyant with
vitality and eagerness, followed after
him, calling out sometimes when he
looked back, &#8220;I&#8217;m all right, Mr.
Overleigh.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last they stood together by the
side of the river, and were able to
see the wholesale destruction which
the storm had wrought. Three
days ago there had been no water
in the river; now there was a raging
torrent, which was cutting down
the banks, tearing up the trees, and
bearing them away in fierce triumph.</p>

<p>First the topmost branches of a
fine sycamore shuddered slightly;
then they trembled, and those who
were watching them, knew that the
tree was doomed. The roots cracked
and groaned, and something snapped.
And the tree fell. Perhaps there
was a moment of resistance even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
then&mdash;but all in vain. The torrent
rushed with redoubled fury on
its victim, and whirled it away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p109.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;HILDA COULD NOT LEAVE THE SPOT.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p>There is a sad fascination in watching
such a scene as this. You feel
you must wait to see whether that
tree yonder will be spared. You do
not think it possible that it too will
yield to the enemy. The others
went, but they were fragile and unstable.
This one surely will have
the strength to withstand all attacks.
You watch, and you turn away perhaps
to see the bank a few yards
farther down, cave in and disappear;
or it may be that you yourself have
to step back and save yourself from
slipping down with the ground which
has given way. You hear a crash&mdash;and
there is your tree fallen! You
feel like holding out your arms to
help a friend. You feel the despair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of knowing that you cannot help.
The torrent seizes your tree, attacks
it with overwhelming force, and
sweeps it onwards, onwards. And
you linger there, remembering sadly
that there is one tree less in a barren
land, where every green branch is
dearly prized; one tree less in that
belt of green in the valley, so soothing
and restful to the eye through
all the months of the year.</p>

<p>Hilda could not leave the spot.
She was so excited and interested,
and so concerned at seeing the trees
rooted up, that Ben began to wonder
whether he would ever get her home
again; and indeed every moment
something fresh was occurring to attract
their attention. Now a window
and now a door tore past, and now
a great olive-tree, and now a pig,
and now a pump.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;We must be starting for home,&#8221;
he said at last. &#8220;The storm will
be coming on again. Do you see
those threatening clouds yonder?
My word, there has been a tremendous
deal of damage done already,
and we&#8217;ve not finished with it yet.
I hope to goodness none of those
boys have suffered. Their land lies
low, and this river is cutting away
the country right and left.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to him with sudden
eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tremendously exciting,&#8221; she
said, clasping her hands over her
head, and drawing a long breath.
&#8220;If you have not seen anything of
the kind before, it works you up to a
terrible pitch. I don&#8217;t know exactly
what it makes one feel like: one does
not think of oneself or one&#8217;s own concerns:
one just watches and wonders.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, looking at her
with fresh interest, for her eagerness
and animation were giving an added
charm to her personality. &#8220;Come,
before we are caught by the rain.
Robert will be anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert will be anxious,&#8221; she
echoed dreamily, and at once the
brightness faded from her face. It
was as though some sudden remembrance
had quenched her vitality and
her interest. She followed Ben over
the meadows, and when they had
gained the road safely, she glanced
at the scene which they had left,
and then turned slowly homewards.
There was something in her manner
which forbade conversation, and Ben
walked by her side, twirling his great
moustaches, and wondering how things
would eventually work themselves
out between Robert and herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
His own feelings towards her this
afternoon were a curious mixture of
resentment and attraction. He was
almost angry with himself for being
attracted towards her, but he could
not help admiring her face and her
strength and her whole bearing. She
stalked by his side like a young
panther. She was as strong as he
was, stronger perhaps, and with more
vitality in her little finger than poor
old Bob in his whole tired body.</p>

<p>At last she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Overleigh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you
and Robert have been great friends
together for a long time now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; he answered brightly.
&#8220;This is the land of friendships, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it is the land
of something beautiful,&#8221; she said
bitterly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Does it frown to you so very
much?&#8221; he asked kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered almost fiercely.
&#8220;Terribly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if we have a beautiful spring,
you will think differently of it,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she replied, standing
still for the moment; &#8220;nothing could
make me like it. It isn&#8217;t only the
scenery&mdash;it&#8217;s everything: the isolation,
the fearful distance from home,
the absence of stimulus. One doesn&#8217;t
realise this at home. If one only
realised it, one would not come.
Nothing would make one come,&#8221;
she continued excitedly, &#8220;neither
love nor friendship, nor duty nor regret;
and as for ambition to carve
out a new career for oneself&mdash;good
heavens! if I were a man, I would
rather starve in my old career.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Her thoughts, till now locked in
her heart, were leaping into freedom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you only
knew what a relief it is to me to speak
out to some one. I have been suffocated
these last days, and every
hour it has been getting worse. I&#8217;ve
written letters&mdash;oh, yes, I&#8217;ve written
letters and torn them up in despair.
The distance is so great, that it paralyses
one. You can&#8217;t send a chronicle
of misery six thousand miles.
It&#8217;s just absurd mockery to do it.
It&#8217;s only a caricature of your depression.
It helps you a little to write it,
and then you must tear it up at once,
and that is all the comfort you will
have out of it. Oh, it is better
than nothing: anything is better than
nothing, when you have to keep silent,
and when some one near you is watching
constantly for your look of approval<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and waiting for your word of
approbation, and you cannot give
either. You are simply forced to be
silent. But when you are able to
speak out your real thoughts to a
human being, then you breathe again,
as I&#8217;m breathing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, and Ben was silent too.
He did not know what to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why, why do people come
here?&#8221; she continued; &#8220;what do
they find here to like? What do
they get in exchange for all they&#8217;ve
lost? Why, in the name of heaven,
did Robert settle in such a place?&mdash;why
did <i>you</i> choose to come here?
Are you going to stay here all your
lives? Tell me what it all means.
Tell me frankly and honestly whether
you care for your life here, and
whether you would not throw it up
to-morrow if you could.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;I will tell you what it all means,&#8221;
said Ben, slowly; &#8220;it means that it&#8217;s
a land and a life for men, and not for
women. We men gain in every particular:
no more small clerkships for
us, no more imprisonment in airless
offices; but out-of-door freedom, and
our own lives to ourselves, and our
own land. That is what it all means
to us. To you women&mdash;well&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;To you women it is altogether
something different,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and unless you all know how to
love desperately, there is not much to
redeem the life out here for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, apparently not much,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;So here, as everywhere, the
women come off the worst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be so,&#8221; he answered
reluctantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>&#8220;Unless we can manage to love
desperately,&#8221; she said, in bitter scorn,
&#8220;and then even Southern California
can become a paradise to us. Is that
what you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that love and friendship
can make things easier, even on a
lonely ranch in Southern California,&#8221;
Ben replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men are to have eternal freedom
from airless offices and small
clerkships, and to enjoy out-of-door
lives, and revel in the possession of
their ranches,&#8221; Hilda continued;
&#8220;and the women are to do work to
which they have never been accustomed
at home, are to drudge and
drudge day after day in an isolated
place without a soul to talk to, and
their only compensation is to love
desperately. A pretty picture indeed!
Oh, well, it is folly of me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
talk of it, perfect folly, and to you of
all people, Bob&#8217;s friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better to Bob&#8217;s friend than to
Bob himself,&#8221; Ben said quietly.</p>

<p>She glanced up at him. There
was something so soft in his voice
whenever he spoke of Robert. Hilda
was touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are anxious on Robert&#8217;s behalf?&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered simply. &#8220;I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on in silence for a
few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, we have been such
close friends,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I
nursed him through a bad illness,
and learned to look upon him as my
own property. He came into my
life, too, at a time when I was desolate.
The world seemed a desert
to me. But Bob held out his hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and helped me along to a green
place. I have found many green
places since then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With such a close friendship
as that, you must surely resent
my presence out here,&#8221; Hilda said
tentatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said staunchly, &#8220;I resent
it most deeply, if you do not
make him happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda smiled. She liked his candour;
she liked everything about
him.</p>

<p>They had reached the road which
led up to her house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I won&#8217;t
come in just now. I must make
my way back whilst it is still fine.
Tell Bob I&#8217;ll be in to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood watching him for a moment,
and then she went home.</p>

<p>As she opened the door, her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
came forward to greet her, with
a smile of love and welcome on his
face. Everything was ready for her:
the cloth was laid, the food was
cooked, the kettle was boiling, there
were fresh flowers on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Robert,&#8221; she said warmly,
&#8220;and you&#8217;ve done everything for
me, and you so tired with the day&#8217;s
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush,&#8221; he said, smiling sadly,
&#8220;the day&#8217;s trouble is past.&#8221;</p>

<small>ATTRACTION AND REPULSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE were three days more
of incessant rain and wind,
and then the storm ceased, and the
sun shone brightly. On the morning
of the second fine day, a waggon
drove up to Hilda&#8217;s house, and
Holles got off, leaving Ben in charge
of the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;We called in to see if we could
do anything for you in the village,&#8221;
he said, when Hilda opened the door
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be ever so much obliged
if you would bring me a sack of
flour,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I have just come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to the end of my supply. Robert
did not want to send our horses in
yet. He says the roads are not
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose they are,&#8221;
said Holles. &#8220;But if you had been
living on preserved pine-apples and
empty coal-oil tins for the last week
or ten days, you would be willing to
risk a good deal for the sake of some
flour or a piece of Porter House
steak. We fellows over the river
have been starving. Empty coal-oil
tins and preserved pine-apples
are not very fattening, are they?
But there, I mustn&#8217;t grumble. We
managed to get over to Ben one
day, and he gave us one of his skinniest
fowls in exchange for a large
jar of my best marmalade. There
was nothing on the fowl; but there
never is anything on Ben&#8217;s fowls, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
we weren&#8217;t disappointed. Only for
goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t tell that to him.
He&#8217;s awfully touchy on the subject!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda laughed, and asked about
the damages done by the storm on
the other side of the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Graham has come off very badly,&#8221;
Holles answered. &#8220;His house was
taken clean away, and three acres of
his best olives are completely ruined.
We have some fearful cuts on our
land, and the poor devil of a Chinaman
who had his kitchen-garden half
a mile away from our place has lost
everything, cabbages, asparagus, pig-tail,
and all. Graham is living with
us just now, and he says he must
have something to eat to keep up
his spirits. So I said I would risk
my valuable life for the good of the
whole community. The waggon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
horses are Ben&#8217;s. After I got across
the river, I went and stormed at him
until he hitched up. He did not
want to come with me, and began
swearing at me in that poetical fashion
of his, until I referred casually to the
skinny fowls raised on his ranch, and
then he said: &#8216;Hold hard, Jesse, I&#8217;ll
come with you.&#8217; So we are off together,
and if you do not hear anything
more of us, you will know that
we have found a muddy grave!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; Hilda said. &#8220;I hope
you will come safely back, bringing
my flour, and the mail. And some
day I want you to tell me about
your experiences with the ear-trumpet
lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; sang out Holles,
cheerily. &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, looking
down like a shy boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;We fellows are all so sorry about
the reservoir,&#8221; he said kindly. &#8220;If
there is anything we can do to help
old Bob, we&#8217;re all ready and willing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was off quickly after that, and
Hilda watched him jump into the waggon
and take possession of the reins.
Then he cracked the big black snake,
and started away in grand style.</p>

<p>&#8220;Confound you, Holles!&#8221; Ben
said, as they rattled over the roads.
&#8220;Do drive carefully. You will be
landing us in one of those holes;
I&#8217;ll take the lines. I don&#8217;t want
the waggon smashed up, and the
horses lamed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, old man,&#8221; Holles replied
cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll promise to be
careful, but I cannot possibly let you
drive. I always feel like going to my
own funeral when you handle the
whip. Here, get up, boys. Don&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
be frightened of the mud. We&#8217;re
not going to stick yet. Get up, boys!
But, by Jove, Ben, the roads are
heavy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not fit for travelling
yet,&#8221; Ben answered. &#8220;But you worried
me into coming. It is better to
give in to you and have peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grumble away as much as you
like,&#8221; Holles answered; &#8220;I would
rather have any amount of your
grumblings than one of your fowls.
What on earth do you do to your
fowls to turn them out so thin? You
might make your fortune by exhibiting
them. They&#8217;re quite unique!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t chatter so much, and look
out where you are going,&#8221; said Ben,
pretending not to notice Jesse&#8217;s chaff.</p>

<p>Holles laughed, and drove on
silently for a few minutes. Then he
said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s a bad piece of luck about
Bob Strafford&#8217;s reservoir. Poor fellow!
He will take it dreadfully to
heart. And I am sorry for her too.
It must be lonely for her in this part
of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand
about women,&#8221; Holles continued.
&#8220;If I were a fine girl like
that, nothing on earth would induce
me to come out to this kind of
existence. Any one can see that she
is out of place here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The women have a bad time of
it in a new country,&#8221; Ben said slowly.
&#8220;If you talk to any one of them, it
is nearly always the same story, home-sickness
and desolation, desolation
and home-sickness. I remember last
year up north meeting such a handsome
woman. Her husband had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
made quite a good thing out of Lima
beans, and they had everything they
wanted. But she told me that she
did not know how to live through the
first ten years of home-sickness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a cheerful prospect for
Mrs. Strafford,&#8221; said Holles.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will probably work her
way through, as they all do,&#8221; answered
Ben. &#8220;Women are wonderful
creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You always have something to
say for women,&#8221; said Holles. &#8220;You
ought to go back to the old country,
and help them get the suffrage and
all that sort of thing. You are lost
to them out here. How my maiden
aunt, who only lives for the Cause,
as she calls it, would adore you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben smiled, and then said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert&#8217;s ranch has been put back
at least three years. I don&#8217;t suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
Mrs. Strafford realises that yet. But
it is very hard on her, and cruel for
him. He has worked untiringly,
poor chap, and used every means in
his power to reach success. Well, I
simply cannot speak of it, Jesse. It
chokes me. Look out now. There&#8217;s
something ahead. Don&#8217;t go an inch
out of the road, or we shall get
mired.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they came nearer, they saw
that a cart, heavily laden with large
bales of hay, had stuck in the mud.
Two men were leading the horses
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we pass?&#8221; Ben asked of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just enough room to
manage it,&#8221; one of them answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try for it,&#8221; said Holles.
&#8220;Get up, boys!&#8221;</p>

<p>They might have been able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
creep past in safety, but that one of
the team shied at the bales of hay,
and swerved about three feet from
the road. In an instant, the horses
were plunging in the mud, and the
spring-waggon had sunk up to the
hubs. Ben took the black snake,
and whipped up the poor brutes,
and, together with Holles, shouted,
coaxed, and swore.</p>

<p>But they had gone down so deep
that they could not free themselves.
They plunged and paddled and
struggled hard to drag out the waggon,
until at last one of them, more
faint-hearted than the other, gave up
trying, and began nibbling the grass.</p>

<p>Ben and Holles jumped down, and
walked very gingerly over the soft
ground, which, in the neighbourhood
of the horses&#8217; hoofs, was precisely
like pea-soup. They unhitched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
animals, who then sprang forward
and gained firm footing once more.
There they stood tired and panting,
their long tails looking like house-painter&#8217;s
brushes steeped in rich
brown colouring.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be worried again into
bringing my team out so soon after
a storm,&#8221; said Ben, half humorously,
as he stroked both the horses. &#8220;They
don&#8217;t care about a mud bath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt them,&#8221; answered
Holles. &#8220;In fact it is a capital thing
for the health. My maiden aunt
used to go every year to Karlsbad
for the mud baths, and after the
tenth season she really began to feel
the benefit of them. All the same,
Ben, I am glad we had not to dig
out the horses. That is the very
devil. Now for the waggon. I have
a brilliant idea.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>He saw a rope in the hay cart, and
at once possessed himself of it. He
fastened it to the pole of their own
waggon, and attached it to the horses.
Then once more Ben cracked the
black snake, and the horses, being
now on solid ground, tugged and
tugged, and at last pulled out the
waggon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to thank your stars
you had me with you,&#8221; said Holles,
as they started on their way again.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so wonderfully ingenious.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drove into the village in grand
style, much elated that he and Ben
had come off so easily. A great
many men were gathered together
at the grocery-store, which was also
the post-office, and horses and buggies
of every description were crowding
the road: most of the horses
looked as though they had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
mired, and several of them wore an
air of depression born of wounded
pride. Others obviously did not care
whether or not their appearance was
changed for the worse, and received
with stolid indifference the various
uncomplimentary remarks bestowed
on their tails.</p>

<p>This was the first time of meeting
since the great storm, and every one
had something to tell about his own
experiences. There was anxiety expressed
about the enormous earth
dam of the Nagales reservoir which
supplied the Flume. If it had burst,
as some one reported, untold-of damage
would have been done; and
moreover, the whole water-supply for
the summer months&#8217; irrigating would
have been wasted. This was a terrible
prospect, and especially so after
a long drought of exceptional severity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
But the postmaster, who was busy
distributing the accumulation of several
days&#8217; mail, said there was no
truth in the report.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish there was no truth in the
news about poor old Strafford&#8217;s dam,&#8221;
said some one. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you contradict
it, Overleigh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only too true,&#8221; he said
sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a miserable thing to
happen, and so soon after his marriage,&#8221;
said the postmaster. &#8220;Are
you taking his mail, Mr. Holles?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Holles. &#8220;Great
powers! Is this cart-load for him?
Oh, I see, it&#8217;s mostly for his wife.
What a stunning lot of papers! By
Jove! I wish my people would send
me some. The only thing I ever
get from the old country is &#8216;The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Young Christian at Home.&#8217; And
Lauderdale gets &#8216;The Christian
Household.&#8217; No wonder we are
always depressed. Here, stay a moment,
Ben. I&#8217;m not through with
the shopping. I&#8217;ve nearly forgotten
Mrs. Strafford&#8217;s sack of flour. And
I want a tin of oysters. Graham
is so upset about losing his three
acres of olives, that he says the only
possible thing to help him is <i>boiled
oysters on toast</i>. Well, now I am
about ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a greeting here and a nod
there, the two friends drove off.
Ben took the reins, and Holles sorted
the mail, and seemed greatly interested
in the outsides of Mrs. Strafford&#8217;s
newspapers and magazines, and
in their insides too, for he held each
one up to the light, looking through
it as though through a telescope.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;Well, I wish they were for me,&#8221;
he said, as he pushed them away and
lit his pipe. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t grudge
them to her. I daresay she is terribly
home-sick for old England: and
the mail will cheer her up. Somehow
or other I feel sorry for her&mdash;don&#8217;t
you, Ben? What do you
think of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Ben, slowly.</p>

<p>And he spoke the truth. He had
thought of her constantly ever since
his long walk and talk with her. He
recalled her fierce distress, her sudden
breaking down of the barrier of
reserve, her cry of relief at being able
to speak openly about the isolation
and unattractiveness of the life and
land. He remembered every word
she had said; he remembered every
gesture. In turning the whole matter
over in his mind, he was torn by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
several conflicting feelings: sympathy
with her suffering, indignation with
himself for being able to sympathise
at all with her, resentment against
her for her cold criticism of Robert
in the very midst of his distress, a
growing suspicion that her nature had
nothing to offer of tender love and
passionate devotion, and an uneasy
consciousness that in spite of all this,
and in spite of his loyal and long
attachment to poor old Bob, there
was something about her personality
which attracted him immensely, something
gallant in her bearing, and something
irresistible in her appearance.
He could not but admire her, and he
hated himself for it.</p>

<p>He did not listen to Jesse Holles&#8217;s
chatter, and he looked with indifference
at the country smiling now in
serene sunshine, and at the softened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
lights on the mountains. Holles
tried to draw his attention to a few
blades of grass springing up on the
roadside, and as they neared Robert&#8217;s
house, he glanced down into the
valley and exclaimed with delight
when he saw the river glistening like
gold. But Ben, usually so susceptible
to the beauties of nature, and so
enthusiastic about the varying charms
of this wild expanse of scenery which
he greatly loved, noticed nothing.</p>

<p>Then the sound of a harsh voice
recalled him from his musings, and
there stood Hilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are back safely,&#8221; she said
brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Holles, as he handed
out her letters and papers. &#8220;We
were badly mired going; but the
marvel is that we did not sink up
to our very eyes coming back, owing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
to the heavy weight of your mail.
But, oh, how I envy it! How I
should enjoy those papers! This
is not a hint. It is merely an emotional
observation, which I regret
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not regret it,&#8221; laughed
Hilda. &#8220;I hope you will all read
my papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will try,&#8221; said Holles,
quaintly. &#8220;And here is the sack
of flour. I will just lift it into the
house. It is a perfectly lovely day.
Spring has come!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE GREAT MIRACLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TO enjoy and appreciate to its
fullest possibilities a Californian
spring, let me choose, for one,
to live first through a Californian
summer. Then I can see the great
miracle with my own eyes, watch it
in its tiniest and swiftest workings,
and follow it with loving wonder.</p>

<p>Now those plains and slopes yonder
lay bare and brown for many
months: everything on them was
scorched up and covered with thickening
dust. The sumac, to be sure,
kept its greenness, and even sent out
tender shoots, just to remind us perhaps
that Nature was not really dead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
but slumbering beneath her ugly garment
of dust and withered growth,
even as elsewhere she takes her time
of rest beneath a lovelier covering of
purest white. The foothills were
barren of any kind of beauty: the
very stones and rocks wore an uncompromising
air of ugliness, and
the whole country seemed to be
without a single charm until the
hour of sunset, and then the mountains
were tinged with purple light,
and the great boulders themselves
appeared to have donned for the
moment a suit of purple heather.</p>

<p>Ah, for the green pastures in other
countries then, for the deep lanes,
and forests of trees, for the brooks
and rivers, for the grass and ferns
and mosses, and for everything in
Nature soothing to the eye and
comforting to the spirit!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>But as time went on, my friends,
regret and longing crept stealthily
away, and curiosity and wonder took
their place, for some change was
coming over the country, almost
imperceptible and most mysterious.
There was no rain, but the night-fogs
cast their moisture on the
dried-up bush and starved-looking
chaparral. Tiny leaves broke forth
and gave the first sure sign that the
long summer sleep was over. And
surely those hills had lost their
former crude brown colouring, and
had mellowed into tenderer tints.
There was a softening spell over
everything, and a strange sense of
unrest. The heavens looked troubled,
and threatened rain at last. But still
no rain came, and yet one might see
how the fresh growth was struggling
to assert itself unaided. Then, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
many days of waiting, the rains
fell.</p>

<p>And Nature began to work her
beautiful miracle. She had delayed
so long that she had to work quickly;
but those who cared enough, could
follow her in every detail.</p>

<p>A few faint signs of grass on the
roadside, the palest shimmer of green
on the slopes, fine little leaves springing
from the ground, a tiny flower
here and there, and in the ca&ntilde;ons
frail ferns.</p>

<p>Then a luxuriance of green: vast
expanses of young fresh grain on the
foothills and in the great plain yonder:
stretches of emerald grass almost
dazzling in its intensity, with a
dash of even brighter colour, matched
only by the sea-moss on the rocks:
green fields of pasture in the valley,
and on the heights green brushwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
spread like a soft velvet mantle over
the distant ridges.</p>

<p>And then the flowers springing up
in places where neither growth nor
life seems possible.</p>

<p>Carpets of the little pink blossom
of the alfilaria, the first spring flower:
carpets of the golden violets charged
with delicious fragrance, and of the
shooting-stars, so dainty with petals
of white and delicate purple, and so
generous of sweetest perfume.</p>

<p>Colours of every hue: masses of
wild hyacinths, pale lavender in
shade, thousands of yellow flowers
varying from a faint tint to a deep
orange: blue, pink, red, purple
flowers, any you will, and amongst
them delicate white ones of many
lovely designs.</p>

<p>And the splendid poppy flaming
and flashing in the sunlight, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
rich indigo larkspur, and the vetches
and lupins and the lilies&mdash;how can
one tell of them all, and how can one
describe the gladness and gratitude
and wonder which their presence calls
forth?</p>

<p>And then in ca&ntilde;ons and timbered
hiding-places, known only to those
who pry and probe, many a curious
and lovely flower. And as the weeks
go on, fresh treasures, revealing
themselves in place of those which
have passed out of sight: glorious
monster poppies of crinkled white
satin, and yellow hairy mariposa
lilies, just like luscious yellow butterflies.
Vines and creepers trailing on
the ground, and festooning shrubs
and rocks; sweet scents wafted now
from here and now from there, and
now mingling together in fragrant
accord.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>And all these wonders tenfold
more wonderful because of that
burnt and dried-up soil from which
nothing beautiful seemed possible.</p>

<p>But stay! The summer is here
once more. The foothills are brown
again: the slopes and plains where
the grain has been grown and cut,
have chosen for themselves the
colour of old gold plush. Brown
and old gold: surely a charming
combination.</p>

<p>Is it that familiar scenes take on
an ever-increasing beauty? Is it
that the more intently we look, all
the more surely do we see fresh loveliness;
just as when gazing into the
heavens at eventide, first one star reveals
itself to us, and then another?
Or is it that we know spring will
come indeed, bringing those treasures
which enchanted us?</p>

<small>ROBERT TAKES HEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SO every day the country put on
fresh beauties, and Robert was
a little comforted to see that Hilda
took pleasure in watching the quick
growth and marking the constant
change in the scenery.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the wild-flowers are at
their best,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will begin
to think that Southern California is
a beautiful land after all. That foot-hill
yonder will be aglow with orange-coloured
poppies, and those other
slopes over there across the river
will be covered with brightest mustard.
I admire the mustard more
than anything.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>She smiled at him, and found
something kind to say about all the
wonderful surprises in store for her,
and she seemed so appreciative of the
fresh charms of the country, which
were unfolding themselves to her one
by one, that he began to hope she
might yet learn to care for the new
life and the new land. He put his
troubles bravely on one side, and
went back to work. Hilda saw him
contemplating his ruined ranch; and
when he came in, although he tried
to conceal his feelings, yet his thin
face wore a peculiar look of pain,
which softened her almost into tenderness.
He said very little about the
disaster, and spoke only of filling up
the wash, levelling the land, ploughing
and cultivating it, and getting
it in good condition for the planting
of fresh lemon-trees. All this meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
terribly hard work, and he looked
really quite unfit to take the slightest
exertion. Ben was anxious about
him, and came over every day to
help with the cultivating of that part
of the ranch which had escaped
damage. He pushed Bob quietly
away, and took possession of the
cultivator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down and smoke, old man,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re about as fit as a
kitten to do this kind of job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was glad enough to rest.
He watched Ben, smoked his pipe,
and smiled to hear his friend swearing
at the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so fearfully tired, Ben,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I suppose it is the worry
and the disappointment and all that.
But I shall be rested in a day or two,
and then I must tackle that waste
land. I daresay in a fortnight&#8217;s time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
if we don&#8217;t have any more rain, the
ground will be solid enough to be
worked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a big business,&#8221; Ben
said, glancing in that direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have no peace until I
have started it,&#8221; Bob said doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we are all coming to help,&#8221;
Ben answered. &#8220;All the fellows
are sorry, and you will have quite a
little gang round you. Holles is a
splendid worker when he chooses,
and he will go ahead like a ship on
fire for your sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You boys are good to me,&#8221; Bob
said gratefully. &#8220;I know you will
help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he added half-shyly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The little wife is ever so kind
about the whole affair. And I do
believe she is beginning to like the
life out here better than she ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
thought she would. I&#8217;ve been terribly
worried about her, Ben. In
spite of my great happiness, I feel
it was selfish of me to ask her to
leave England and her people, and
the many pleasures and interests she
has always had in her life over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She needn&#8217;t have come,&#8221; Ben
answered stoutly.</p>

<p>Bob smiled happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that is just the comfort of
it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She came because she
cared about me. But, nevertheless,
I am anxious the whole time. When
anything pleases her, I cheer up a
little, and lately she has taken so
kindly to the riding. She will soon
be a splendid horsewoman. She looks
well on a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, by Jove!&#8221; answered Ben,
enthusiastically.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;And the country is coming on
beautifully,&#8221; continued Bob. &#8220;We
shall have an abundance of flowers.
That will be a pleasure to her. But
she does not touch the piano. She
sits down beside it, looks at it, and
goes away. At home she used to
play by the hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will play in time,&#8221; said Ben,
kindly; &#8220;just leave her to choose
her own moment. Some day when
you least expect it, you will hear
her touching the notes.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he went away with his heart
very sore about his friend; for though
he believed that Hilda was trying
her best to seize hold of the new
life and make what she could of it,
he remembered his long conversation
with her, and felt that she would
never be reconciled to the lot which
she had deliberately chosen. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
had not once referred to her outburst
of confidence that afternoon: at first
she had seemed a little nervous in
his presence; but as the days passed
by and she saw him constantly, the
slight uneasiness of manner wore off.
She trusted to his kindness, and he
knew it. He knew, too, that she liked
him and looked forward to seeing
him, and, for his own part, he could
not but admire the brave attempt
she was making to adapt herself to
these difficult circumstances. It was
altogether admirable. But that set
expression on her face betrayed to
him the real state of her mind, and
he trembled for Bob. And yet he
had to own that she was good to her
husband. Strong as a panther herself,
she did not understand much
about ill-health, but she tried to save
his strength. Only she did not love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
him. It was this that Ben resented
in her. Still he was greatly attracted
to her at times, much against his will
and against his prejudices. Then he
would go home twirling his moustaches,
and swearing softly and
continuously.</p>

<p>So the weeks slipped away, and
Bob began to work at the ruined
half of his ranch. He looked very
frail, and there was something about
his unrelenting doggedness which
filled Ben with alarm. Nothing
would induce him to spare himself
over this difficult task. He might
be seen at any hour of the day struggling
with that stubborn land, filling
up the wash-outs, now and then
pausing to rest, and after a few moments
returning with redoubled zeal
to his tedious occupation. It made
no difference to his quiet persistence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
when the other men came to help
him. Ben worked alongside with
him, and could not induce him to
leave off; Graham, Lauderdale, and
Holles rode over constantly and gave
him the best of their strength and
willingness, but he never relaxed for
their presence; indeed they rather
stimulated him to further efforts.
Holles was in capital form, and kept
every one in good spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never remembered to have
worked as hard as this,&#8221; he said once
or twice. &#8220;It just shows what a
beautiful character I am, if people
would only believe it. I would not
have done it for myself. But I am
not really properly appreciated in
this neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda liked him immensely, and
was always ready to hear his unique
experiences by land and by sea. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
laughed till the tears streamed down
her cheeks, for Holles had quite his
own method of narrating. He told
her, too, of his famous feud with the
ear-trumpet lady, and how he had refused
to work for her because he preferred
not to be watched through an
opera-glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben does not mind being watched
through an opera-glass,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I believe Bob rather likes it.
But, even if I were on the verge
of starvation, I would not work on
such infamous conditions. No; I
still have some lingering sense of
dignity, and that wretched old
woman will never have the benefit
of my valuable services. But there!
I forgot she was a friend of yours
and had lent you her piano. Does
she come and listen to you through
an opera-glass?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;She came once,&#8221; answered Hilda,
&#8220;but she did not ask me to play,
and she was particularly kind about
the piano, and told me to keep it as
long as I pleased. She is away now,
but when she returns, I must go and
see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I think all the better of
her,&#8221; said Holles, brightly. &#8220;Perhaps
I will work for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he told Hilda he was passionately
fond of music, and he
asked her to play for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never cared for anything
so much as for music,&#8221; he said
gently. &#8220;It always had a mysterious
influence over me. Do you
know, I believe it appeals to the
best part of us. Sometimes when
I&#8217;ve been in the back-country
knocking about and not knowing
where I was going next, a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
painful yearning for music has come
over me, and I have positively suffered
from the deprivation. At
moments like that, it is an awful
thing to be cut off from all possibility
of easing one&#8217;s longing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda made no answer. She
touched the key-board, and after
hesitating, she played some dainty
old French gavotte. She followed
it up with a mazurka by Godard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you like that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Jesse&#8217;s face had fallen. He looked
unsatisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Play me something sad now,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That is the music one
cares for most, because it is the
truest, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her fingers wandered aimlessly
over the notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can play anything
sad to you,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p161.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;HILDA AT THE WINDOW.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked shyly, for
her manner had suddenly intimidated
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t believe I dare
trust myself,&#8221; she said, more to
herself than to him.</p>

<p>She struck a few chords and began
one of Chopin&#8217;s Nocturnes. She
broke off abruptly, rose from the
piano, and went to the window.
When she turned round again
Holles had gone. He had understood.</p>

<p>But out on the ranch, Ben and
Bob looked at each other when
they heard the strains of music, and
Bob&#8217;s face was aglow with pleasure.
Ben was glad too.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little wife has gone back to
her music,&#8221; Bob said. &#8220;Now all will
be well with her. I feel as though
things were going on better, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
as though she were not fretting so
much for the old country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the music ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She did not finish that melody,&#8221;
he said, a little uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay she is tired,&#8221; Ben said
reassuringly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hilda rested on the
honeysuckle verandah, and looked
at the distant ranges of mountains,
and the foothills nestling up to them
as children to their parents; she
listened to the sweet notes of the
mocking-bird who had lately taken
up his quarters on the barn; she
watched the flight of a company of
wild ducks; and she glanced at the
garden, where the flowers were growing
apace.</p>

<p>The camphor-trees were coming
on bravely, and she was glad to see
that the grass was sprouting up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
She tried to give her mind to each
separate thing which attracted her attention;
and as the sun sank, and
the tender rosy glow spread over hill
and mountain, she stared fixedly at
the beautiful sight until it faded into
a tender vagueness. And then once
more Chopin&#8217;s Nocturne stole on her
remembrance, overwhelming her with
regret and longing.</p>

<small>SCHUMANN&#8217;S NACHTST&Uuml;CK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERYTHING went on as usual
in the little community. Robert
Strafford worked incessantly, and,
in addition to the help he received
from his friends, had engaged the<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
services of a Chinaman, and had
made great strides with the redeeming
of his land. His father had sent
him some money, and told him that
he should remit a further sum in a
month or two, and Robert went to a
lemon-nursery at once and bought
five hundred Lisbons, budded on the
sour root. He was so engrossed in
his ranch that he did not notice how
little interest Hilda was taking in
all his schemes. She seemed cheerful,
and was busy from morning till
night, had learnt to milk the cow,
and even helped on the ranch; but
Ben, who observed her closely,
believed that her cheerfulness was
assumed, and that her ready conversation
came from the lips only,
and that her eagerness for work
arose merely from her desire to do
battle with her regrets. But Bob<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
had taken heart and courage about
her; and now eased in monetary
matters by his father&#8217;s generous help,
felt that he was at last coming out
into the sunlight of life. So great
was his confidence in his ultimate
success, and so convincing was his
dogged persistence, that, in spite of
his misfortunes and his frail health,
the minds of his companions leapt
forward, as it were, three or four
years, and the picture of a flourishing
little ranch, more prosperous than
any other in the neighbourhood,
forced itself upon their attention.</p>

<p>It was nearly six weeks now since
Hilda had touched the piano. But
to-day Robert had gone with the
waggon into the village, and she was
alone on the ranch. She had been
reading some of her home letters,
and looking at some photographs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Canterbury and Winchester, half
deciding to frame them, and finally
concluding to put them away. She
opened the piano, and placed her
music on the stand. She chose a
volume of Chopin, another of Schumann,
and some pieces by Brahms
and Grieg. She played well. Her
touch was firm and virile, but wanting
in tenderness. She played one
of Chopin&#8217;s Impromptus and one
of his Ballades, and after that she
passed on to his Nocturnes. She
stopped now and again and covered
her face with her hands. She was
quite tearless. Then she played
both of Brahms&#8217; Rhapsodies, and
some numbers out of Schumann&#8217;s
Carn&egrave;val. She leaned back in her
chair, looking almost like a statue.
Her fingers sought the notes once
more, and she played Grieg&#8217;s <i>Einsamer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Wanderer</i>, which is so intensely
sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesse Holles would like that,&#8221;
she said to herself; &#8220;but I could
never play it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused, and her hands rested
insensibly on the keys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I must have been mad,&#8221; she
said, with something like a sob, &#8220;to
have so much and to give it all up,
<i>and for what</i>? Ah, if one could
only free oneself!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drifted into Schumann&#8217;s Kinderscenen,
choosing unconsciously
the saddest numbers, and then she
struck the arpeggio chords and began
his most wonderful Nachtst&uuml;ck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p171.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;HILDA&#8217;S SELF-CONTROL BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is fraught with melancholy, regret,
longing, pity&mdash;and what else
besides? But surely it is idle work
to describe beautiful music. As we
play and as we listen, if we are lovers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of music, we use our own interpretation;
we weave our own feelings, our
own emotions, our own aspirations
and regrets into it, and lo! for the
moment we have made it our own
language.... Before Hilda had
reached the closing phrases of the
Nachtst&uuml;ck, her self-control broke
down completely. She nestled up to
the piano, her arms resting on the
finger-board, her head bowed over
them. She sobbed unceasingly. The
tears streamed unheeded from her
eyes. There seemed to be no end
to the sobbing, no end to the tears.</p>

<p>But at last she raised herself, and
clasped her hands together at the back
of her neck, and looked up. Her
husband was standing in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hilda!&#8221; he cried, and he advanced
a step, his arms extended.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; she cried, turning
from him. &#8220;I want to be alone, I
must be alone, I&#8217;m too utterly
wretched for words. It&#8217;s all of no
use, I can&#8217;t stand this life out here;
it will just kill me&mdash;it isn&#8217;t life, it is
only existence, and such an existence
too! I must have been mad to come&mdash;I
was mad, every one was against
it&mdash;my mother and father and friends,
all of them. But I didn&#8217;t know
what I was coming to&mdash;how could
any one know?&mdash;how could I picture
to myself the desolation and the
deadness and the dull monotony, and
the absence of everything picturesque,
and the barren country, which at its
best can never be comforting? I
hate those mountains there, I could
shake them, and I could go out and
tread down all those wretched rows
of wretched little trees&mdash;it&#8217;s all an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
absurd mockery of a life, it&#8217;s starvation
from beginning to end. You
just feel that there is nothing to live
for, and you cry out the whole time
to be done with it. Yes, I was mad,
mad to leave everything and come&mdash;I
can see it well enough now, when
it is too late. But it was little enough
you told me in your letters. Why
didn&#8217;t you make me understand
clearly what I was coming to? And
yet you did try&mdash;I remember you
tried; but how could any one ever
describe the awful desolation? Oh,
it&#8217;s simply heartbreaking. And to
think it has to continue month after
month, and year after year, and that
there is no escape from it. How
shall I ever bear myself? How can
I possibly go on, drudging all the
day long? For that is what the life
out here means to a woman&mdash;drudgery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and desolation, and it is wickedly
cruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Strafford stood there paralysed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And such an unattractive place
to settle in,&#8221; she continued wildly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
&#8220;when there are entrancing parts of
the country near at hand: I saw
them myself on the journey. If you
had to come, why not have chosen a
spot worth living in, where some
kind of social existence was possible,
instead of burying yourself in a
wilderness like this? But nothing
could ever make up to one for all one
had lost, and if I were a man, I
would rather starve at home in my
old career than cut myself off from
the throb and pulsation of a fuller
life. Yes, indeed I would, and to-morrow
I would turn my face homewards
and thank God that I had
freed myself at last, in spite of every one
and everything, freed myself at
last&mdash;oh God! when I think of it
all....&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert&#8217;s face was ashen. Twice he
tried to speak, and his voice failed
him.</p>

<p>Then he said, quite quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Never fear, Hilda, you shall have
your freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>He opened the door, and passed
noiselessly out of the house.</p>

<small>A STRICKEN MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HE chose the road which led to
Ben&#8217;s ranch, and he went
along at an almost feverish pace,
not stopping to rest for a single
moment, during all those seven miles.
When Ben saw him, he knew at once
from the terrible expression on his
face that some trouble had befallen
him. He led him silently into the
house, pushed him gently into the
arm-chair, and, with a tenderness all
his own, forced him to take some
food and stimulant; and then drawing
his chair alongside, and lighting
his pipe afresh, he waited, as close<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
friends know how to wait, for the
moment when the heart desires to
ease itself. At last Robert spoke,
but so quietly that his very manner
would have awed any listener, and
it filled Ben with apprehension.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Hilda has told
me to-night how she hates the whole
life. She bitterly regrets having
come, she bitterly reproaches me
for having settled in the country,
and I recognise the truth of everything
she says. She yearns to be
free again, and she shall have her
freedom. It is the very least I can
do for her. But I&#8217;m a stricken
man. I&#8217;ve been fool enough to
think she cared for me&mdash;I&#8217;ve loved
her so much myself, that it did not
seem possible she could not care a
little for me&mdash;and I&#8217;ve been fool
enough to try and make myself believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
that in time she might get
reconciled to this Californian life.
I might have known it was never
at any moment possible. I&#8217;ve made
a wretched failure of my life and
career over in England and over
here, and I&#8217;ve earned for myself not
her love, nor her tenderness, nor even
her sympathy, but her scorn. Ben,
I felt it in every word she said. I
can never forget my humiliation, I can
never forget her contempt. I could
have fought through other things,
but not that. If that is all one gets
for all one&#8217;s years of longing and
labour, then the game is not worth
the candle. Do you remember me
telling you that the worst thing which
could happen to me would be, not
her changing her mind and throwing
me over, but her disappointment
and her scorn? Do you remember<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
that? You laughed at me, and tried
to chase away my misgivings, but it
seems to me now that our misgivings
are about the only things in our
lives which cannot be called failures.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben drew nearer to his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;take
heart again. She was home-sick perhaps,
and all the home-longings came
leaping out. She could not have
meant to be hard. She will bitterly
regret her words, and all will be
well between you again. You will
forgive her, and the wound will be
healed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to forgive,&#8221;
Robert said quietly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame
her at all, but I blame myself bitterly,
bitterly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I blame her,&#8221; said Ben,
fiercely, &#8220;and face to face I shall
tell her so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;The only thing I have against
her is that she has not cared in the
very least for me,&#8221; Robert said,
&#8220;and words cannot mend that, Ben.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned back wearily in the
chair, looking almost as though he
had ceased to be of this world. The
silence was broken only by the note
of the mocking-bird, and the noise
of the brown mare knocking impatiently
against the stall.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must go home to the life
which she gave up for me,&#8221; Robert
said, after a long pause. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want her sacrifices: they are not
worth anything to me. I think I
have enough money left for her passage,
and if not, I know you will
help me out. I must give her her
freedom at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, but sank back
with a groan, his hand to his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span></p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;&#8216;BEN,&#8217; HE MURMURED, &#8216;WE MUST&mdash;&#8217; HE FAINTED AWAY.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Ben,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;we
must&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He fainted away.</p>

<p>Ben got him on the ground, loosened
his shirt, tended him as he had
so often done before in similar attacks,
and he came back to life once
more. After a time Ben put him
to bed like a little tired child. He
held Ben&#8217;s hand, and looked into
his kind face and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old fellow,&#8221; he said tenderly,
&#8220;dear old fellow. We must
send her home, Ben,&#8221; he said, as he
turned his face to the wall.</p>

<p>Then he raised himself for a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;She was mistaken about one
thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She had seen
some of those settled-up parts on her
way out here, and they seemed attractive
to her, and she reproached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
me for not having bought land there.
But you know, Ben, I had not the
money for that sort of thing; you
know I could not have afforded to
pay fancy prices for my ranch. But it
was only that she did not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that he fell asleep from sheer
exhaustion, and Ben crept back into
the living-room, half beside himself
with indignation and anxiety. He
felt he ought to let Hilda know that
Robert was with him, and yet it was
quite impossible for him to leave his
friend. He longed to see her, and
speak his mind to her about her
cruelty. His whole being was at
feud with her. A torrent of words
rushed to his lips, and broke off into
impotent silence.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.
When he opened it, he found Hilda
outside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;Robert is here?&#8221; she asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert is here,&#8221; he answered
coldly.</p>

<p>He had stood barring the door as
it were, and now he stepped back to
let her pass in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see him at once,&#8221; she
said, turning round defiantly to
Ben.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is sleeping,&#8221; Ben said sternly.
&#8220;At least let him rest awhile.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lit the lamp, and placed it on
the table, and then looked her straight
in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard everything from
Robert,&#8221; she said, shrinking back
almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert has told me of his
trouble,&#8221; Ben answered, trying manfully
to restrain his anger. But he
thought of his friend stricken to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
heart, and his indignation could no
longer be smothered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I blame you bitterly,&#8221; he said,
folding his arms together tightly and
towering before her. &#8220;Yes, you
shall hear what I think of you. He
says he has nothing against you, but
I have everything against you! If
you had not a heart to bring with
you, and some kind of tenderness,
why did you come out here? No
one made you come. You could
have stayed at home if you had chosen.
That would have been better than
this. But to come and give him
nothing but scorn, and throw his
failure in his face, and make him feel
that you despise him for not having
done better in the old country&mdash;I
tell you that you are the one to be
despised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not your part to talk to me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
like this,&#8221; she said, interrupting him
fiercely. &#8220;You are not my judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I do judge you,&#8221; he
flung out fearlessly, and then he
glanced at her, and stopped short in
the very heat of his anger and resentment,
for her face wore a terribly
strained expression of pain, and his
gentler feelings were aroused even
at that moment. &#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;words are not of much use
after all. I am so deeply sorry for
him, and for you too&mdash;there is
nothing I would not do to set things
right for you both.&#8221;</p>

<p>His kinder manner softened her
at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never meant to speak to him
as I did this afternoon,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how it was that I
could not control myself better, but
I was just wild with regret, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
music had stirred me up to such a
pitch that the words came tumbling
out of their own accord; and after it
was all over, and he had gone, I
stood there horrified with myself,
and terrified for him, because I
knew he cared so much. And that
has been the awful part of it all
through: he has cared so much, and
I seemed to have cared so little.
Oh, you don&#8217;t realise how I&#8217;ve tried
to take up this life. Day after day
I&#8217;ve begun over again and struggled
to put from me the dull feeling of
depression, but it came back ten
times worse, until I&#8217;ve been in despair.
Naturally enough you have
only seen the one side, but you
would not think so harshly of me
if you&#8217;d known how I have tried,
and how everything has been against
the grain.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>He turned to her with something
of his old kind bearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you have tried,&#8221; he said
slowly; and some of the pain passed
from her face when he spoke these
words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I would like to see if
he is still sleeping,&#8221; she said, almost
pleadingly.</p>

<p>Ben pointed to the bedroom door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rouse him,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
he sleeps long and heavily, he may
wake refreshed. But I think he is
very ill. He has just had one of his
fainting fits, and an obstinate one
too, and his state of exhaustion afterwards
has made me horribly anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned pale, and went softly
into the bedroom. She came back
in a few minutes, and found Ben preparing
supper. He looked up at her
eagerly, and was relieved when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
told him that Robert was still sleeping
soundly, and that she had not
lingered lest she might disturb him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was murmuring something
about not being able to pay a fancy
price for land,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I wonder
what he meant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He took it greatly to heart that
you thought he might have bought
land in a more settled part of the
country,&#8221; Ben replied. &#8220;But he
could not have afforded to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks very ill,&#8221; Hilda said,
half dreamily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been anxious for him
these many months,&#8221; Ben said quietly.
&#8220;He never had much strength, and
he has overtaxed it with his ranch
and his reservoir. It is the story
of many a rancher in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I have not helped him,&#8221;
Hilda said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Ben was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would give anything on earth
to undo this afternoon&#8217;s work,&#8221; she
said, with painful eagerness. &#8220;And
it&#8217;s so awful to sit here, and not be
able to tell him that. I long for him
to rest, and yet I long for him to wake.
I don&#8217;t know how to bear myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must wait,&#8221; Ben said, gently.</p>

<p>So they waited and watched together.
It was a lovely night, and the
country was bathed in moonlight.
The mountains were darkly outlined
against the silvery sky. The world
seemed to be one vast fairy-land,
wrapt in mystery and peace. On
such a night, a poet might have woven
dreams, an idealist might have seen
bright visions, and to them the hours
would have faded imperceptibly like
the moonlight into dawn.</p>

<p>But to Hilda that time of waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
seemed endless. She looked out
on the fairy scene, and then came
back gratefully to the fire which Ben
had built up directly the night turned
chilly. He sat near her, smoking
his pipe, and twirling his great moustaches.
Once when he saw her
shiver, he rose and fetched a rug
for her, and wrapped it around her,
and threw a few more logs on the
fire. They did not attempt conversation
now: they sat rigidly upright,
waiting for the morning to dawn.
Once she drowsed a little, and when
she opened her eyes again, Ben told
her that Robert had called out loudly
in his sleep, but was now resting
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning is almost here,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;it is half-past three.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span></p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;SHE BENT OVER HER HUSBAND AND LOOKED AT HIS<br />
PALE FACE.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>She drowsed once more, and the
clock was striking five, when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
suddenly started up and stole into
the bedroom. She bent over her
husband and looked at his pale face.
He lay there absolutely still: there
was no sound of breathing&mdash;no
movement of the limbs. A sudden
fear seized her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ben!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;Ben!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben Overleigh heard his name,
and felt a thrill of terror in her voice,
and knew by the answering terror
in his own heart that the dreaded
trouble had come at last. Together
they raised that quiet form, and
strove by every means they knew
to bring it back to consciousness
and life. But in vain.</p>

<p>Then he shrank back from her,
and his fiercest anger took possession
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have your freedom,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<small>PASSION AND LOYALTY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was great sorrow felt
when the news spread about
that Robert Strafford had died, but
there was no surprise, for his friends
had long since seen that he was slipping
away from them, having reduced
himself to the last inch of his strength
through overwork and anxiety. It
was an old story in Southern California,
and one not rightly understood
in the old country, but Ben
Overleigh explained it in the letter
which he wrote to Robert&#8217;s father.</p>

<p>&#8220;We buried him yesterday,&#8221; he
wrote, &#8220;and his wife and we fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
who had known him and loved him,
stood by the grave. He never had
much strength, but what he had, he
taxed to the uttermost. These last
months he worked like one possessed.
No delicate frame could
stand it, and then he was unhappy
about his wife, seeing her so home-sick.
That finished matters for him.
I remember when I first met him
about four years ago, I thought it
sheer madness for a frail young fellow
like that to come out to a life
of physical toil. Ranching is not
child&#8217;s play, and if you want to succeed,
you don&#8217;t sit down and watch
your trees; you work at them the
whole time, and it isn&#8217;t light work.
To leave a city office, and come and
be in the open air during the whole
day sounds inviting, but some of
those who try it, and have not much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
physical strength, go under. I wish
this could be better understood in
the old country. But I expect no
one realises, until he tries for himself,
what hard work manual labour
really is, when one has never been
accustomed to it, and knows nothing
about it. Two years ago a young
English doctor here died in the same
way. He knew he had drained himself
of strength, and that his heart
was worn out. I want you to know
we all loved your son, and as for myself,
he leaves me bereft indeed. I
shall buy his ranch, and work it together
with mine. His wife will no
doubt return as soon as she can, but
at present there is a tremendous railway
strike going on, and we are entirely
cut off from the Eastern States.
But some of the mails get through, and
so I will risk it, and send this letter.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>Ben seemed to be quite a broken
man, and went about his work as one
seeing nothing and caring for nothing.
Graham and Lauderdale and
Holles tried their best to reach him
with their kindness and sympathy;
but he seemed unreachable, as though
he had climbed to some distant mountain,
and had cut himself off from
human aid. But he liked to have
Jesse Holles near him, remembering
always that Jesse had been fond of
Robert, and had given him many
an hour of willing help. He looked
after his ranch as usual, and rode
over to Hilda every day without fail.
He spent very little of his time with
her personally, but worked on Robert&#8217;s
ranch, finding a melancholy satisfaction
in continuing what his friend
had begun. He tended the horses,
and helped Hilda in many ways.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
He cultivated, he pruned, and then
he came up to the house, and sat
down quietly with her, watching her
as she prepared tea, watching and
wondering and turning over many
things in his mind. He was intensely
sorry for her, but he had not told
her that in words, although he knew
she understood it from his deeds.
In spite of all that had occurred, he
could not help being strongly attracted
to her, and sometimes when
he was alone at home, he found himself
torn in pieces by his great bereavement,
by his sympathy with
Hilda&#8217;s remorse, by his attraction
to her, and his repulsion from her.
Thus the storm swept furiously over
Ben Overleigh. He told her once
or twice that he would like to buy
Robert&#8217;s ranch, and he thought they
would not have any difficulty in arranging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
the matter. She did not
make any definite reply, nor did she
show any interest in his suggestion.
She seemed strangely indifferent about
the fate of the ranch, and about her
own affairs and plans, which were
being held in abeyance by the great
railway strike. It was obvious, of
course, that she would return home
as soon as she could, but she never
once spoke of home, and never once
referred to the strike as interfering
in any way with her own intentions.
But she did speak of Robert, and
then there was no mistaking the remorse
in her manner, and the awe
in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never forget how I
wounded him,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Ben did not answer her on these
occasions; and his silence always
stung her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>&#8220;You condemn me utterly,&#8221; she
said, almost pleadingly, and she
showed by her intensity how much
she cared for what this man thought
of her. She showed it all the more
as the days went on, and, after all,
it was natural enough that she
should turn to him as her only
friend in this distant country, where
she was a complete stranger. But
the matter did not end there. She
was strongly attracted to him, and
either she could not or would not
hide it. At one moment a thrill of
contempt would pass through Ben,
and he could have turned from her
as from something which soiled his
soul; and at another moment a
throb of passion would possess him,
and he could have thrown up everything
for her, his loyalty to his
friend, his sense of dignity and fitness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
his own estimate of her character&mdash;everything
he could have
swept to the winds. He noticed,
too, that as the time went on, she
seemed to become more reconciled
to the scenery; and indeed the
country was looking entrancingly
beautiful. All Robert&#8217;s promises
to her had come true: the foothills
were powdered with gold; some of
the slopes were arrayed in bright
attire of orange-coloured poppies,
and others had chosen for themselves
a luxurious garment of wild
mustard. Then there was the dazzling
green grass, and the vast expanse
of grain-fields, and in the
distance yonder there were patches
of purple and yellow flowers, reminding
one of the gorse and
heather in the old country. The
grim barren mountains looked down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
indulgently on all this finery, like
old people who have had their days
of vanity, and are content to watch
the young bedeck themselves so
gaily. And the air was laden with
the heavy fragrances of the flowers
and the orange and lemon blossoms.
Hilda drove out every day,
and brought back endless treasures:
wild lilac, wild azalea, and maiden-hair
from some distant ca&ntilde;on. Her
one consolation was to be out of the
house: she drove, or she rode the
pretty little mare which Robert had
chosen so lovingly for her, and sometimes
she strolled, taking with her a
stout stick in case she came across
any snakes. Nellie, the pointer, who
had fretted piteously since Robert&#8217;s
death, went with her, and whatever
she did, the dog was always to be
seen following her. Hilda&#8217;s health<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
had not suffered from the shock
which she had sustained, but she
often looked anxious and desolate,
and some of the people who saw
her, thought she had changed sadly.
They said that was not to be wondered
at, considering the sad circumstances
of her husband&#8217;s death, and
the long continuance of the railway
strike, which made it impossible for
her to join her friends.</p>

<p>But one evening whilst she was
sitting on the honeysuckle porch,
Holles rode up waving a paper in
his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such good news!&#8221; he cried;
&#8220;the strike is over. There has been
some kind of a compromise between
the company and the men, and some
of the mails are through. I&#8217;ve got a
ton-load for you in this gunny-sack.
Nothing for me, of course, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
my religious paper. That never gets
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>She put the magazines on one side,
and opened her home letters. They
were the first she had received in
answer to her own letter telling of
Robert&#8217;s death. Her father wrote
most kindly, enclosing an order on
one of the banks to cover her passage-money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you will come back at
once,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and take up your
life where you left it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter fell from her hands.</p>

<p>The old life was offered to her
again. There it was waiting for her,
and she was free to go and accept it,
and taste once more of the things for
which she had been starving.</p>

<p>She was free. There was no one
and nothing to hinder her. She
could go back, and put these sad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
events and her remorse and her great
mistake away from her remembrance.
She argued that one had not to
suffer all through one&#8217;s life for a
mistake. She had not meant to be
cruel to poor Robert, but she ought
never to have come at all. And
now she was free to go, and once at
home again these months would
seem to her as a time of which
she had dreamed during an uneasy
night.</p>

<p>But no sense of gladness or thankfulness
came over her. She sat there,
and bit her lips.</p>

<p>Home? What did she want with
home?</p>

<p>She rose and went into the living-room,
carelessly throwing her letters
and papers on the table. The bank
bill fell down, and she stooped and
picked it up, and her fingers moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
as though they were being impelled
to tear it in shreds.</p>

<p>But she tossed it whole on to
the table. She struck a match to
light the lamp, but changed her
mind and let the darkness creep on
unrelieved.</p>

<p>Ben Overleigh rode up half an
hour afterwards, and found her thus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to tell you that the
strike is over, and the train service
begins to-morrow,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard,&#8221; she said rigidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be glad to hear the
news,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This time of waiting
must have been very trying for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now at last you will be able
to go home to your friends,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to speak to you about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
the ranch,&#8221; he continued, a little nervously.
&#8220;I have set my mind on
buying the place, and carrying out
Robert&#8217;s ideas. I hope you will
give me the opportunity. If you
look over his papers, you will find at
what figure he valued his property.
I only speak of it, because I thought
that the certainty of being able to sell
the ranch and receive money down
at once, might make it all the easier
for you, now that the line is open,
to arrange your plans, and return
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Home?&#8221; she echoed, as though
in sudden pain.</p>

<p>Ben started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said quickly, &#8220;back to
the life for which you have been
hungering ever since you came, back
to all those interests which you threw
away, and then so bitterly regretted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Now your path is clear before you,
and you can go straight on, and forget
that you ever took a side-turning
which led you to uncongenial pastures.
Not every one can do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old life!&#8221; she said wildly,
&#8220;what does one want with the old
life? What do I care about returning?
Why should I go home?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Ben Overleigh&#8217;s
heart leapt within him. <i>Why should
she go home?</i> These words were on
his very lips, and others came rushing
afterwards, struggling and wrestling
for utterance. The storm raging
around and within him for so many
weeks, now assailed him with all its
fury&mdash;and left him standing as firm
as those mountains yonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you stay?&#8221; he said
calmly; &#8220;you have said all along
that this Californian life was detestable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
to you, and that you could never
reconcile yourself to it. Have you
forgotten that afternoon when you
poured out your confidences to me,
and eased your mind of your misery?
Do you remember how you spoke
of the isolation, the fearful distance
from home, and the absence of stimulus,
and the daily drudgery, and the
mistake you had made in coming
out to such a wretched land, and to
such a starved existence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I have not forgotten,&#8221; she
said excitedly; &#8220;that was the first
long breath I&#8217;d taken since I left
England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you remember how you
said that if you&#8217;d only realised what
you were coming to, nothing would
have made you come,&#8221; he continued
deliberately,&mdash;&#8220;neither love nor
friendship, nor duty nor regret; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
that if you had been a man, you
would have preferred to starve in
your old career rather than settle in
such a land as this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she broke in, &#8220;and I
meant every word I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And do you remember how you
asked me what it was we found
to like in the life,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;and whether we would not throw
it up to-morrow if we could, and
what in the name of heaven we
got in exchange for all we had
lost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I remember,&#8221; she said
breathlessly; &#8220;and do you remember
what you said then about the
women?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that we men gained in
every particular, and that it was a
life for men and not for women,&#8221; he
answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;Ah, but there was something
else,&#8221; she said, almost desperately.
&#8220;You said they came off badly here,
but that their one salvation was to
love passionately, desperately&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if I did say so,&#8221; he said,
turning to her fiercely, &#8220;what has
that to do with you and me?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the ring
of contempt in his voice. She
smarted in every fibre of her, and
instantly gathered herself together.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are right,&#8221; she said,
with a quick nervous laugh. &#8220;It
has not anything to do with you and
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had struck a match as she
spoke, and lit the lamp, and she
came from the window where she
had been standing, and pushed into
a heap the letters and papers which
were scattered over the table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>&#8220;That railway strike has lasted a
terribly long time,&#8221; she said, in a
tone of voice utterly different from
her trembling accents of a few minutes
past. &#8220;But now, thank goodness,
it is all over, and I can arrange
my plans at last. My father has
sent the money for my return. But
it is good of you to wish to make
things easy for my journey. I shall
not, however, need any more ready
money, you see, for the cheque is
large enough to pay my expenses
twice over to England.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ben stood there half stunned by
her sudden change of manner, and
by the consummate way in which she
swept from her horizon the whole of
this incident between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now about the ranch,&#8221; she
continued, with the dignity of a
queen. &#8220;I will look out the papers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
to-morrow, and then we will settle
it as you wish. I do not know any
one to whom I could sell dear
Robert&#8217;s ranch with greater pleasure
than to you. But you must
pay me at your leisure. There is
no hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; thought Ben. &#8220;A
few minutes ago this woman was all
but throwing herself at my feet, and
now she stands there and patronises
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could scarcely control his anger
and scorn, but he mastered himself,
and said quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very grateful to have
old Robert&#8217;s ranch. It will be some
consolation to me to take care of it
and make it my own. You know
we loved each other, he and I. But
as for payment, I shall prefer to give
the money down, at once.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;That shall be just as you please,&#8221;
she said, with gracious condescension.
&#8220;And now good-night. I am very
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held out her hand to him, but
he looked her straight in the face,
bowed slightly, and left her.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A FORTNIGHT afterwards, Ben
Overleigh and Jesse Holles
saw Hilda Strafford off at the station.
She looked very pale, and glanced at
Ben uneasily from time to time.
There was neither scorn nor anger in
his manner now, but just the old
gentle chivalry, which was the outcome
of his best self. His face,
too, had lost its expression of restless
anxiety, and there was a dignity about
his whole bearing, which might well
have been the outward and visible
sign of the quiet dignity of his mind,
won after a fierce struggle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;You shall have news of the
ranch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When the lemons
come into bearing, you shall know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled her thanks, and turning
to Jesse, she asked whether
she could do anything for him in
England.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said sadly, &#8220;kiss the
dear ground for me.&#8221; And he added
more cheerfully: &#8220;And send me
an illustrated paper sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for you?&#8221; she asked of
Ben, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kiss the dear ground for me,
too,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>And this time he held out his
hand to her, and she grasped it.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
